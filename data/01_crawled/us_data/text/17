SEC. 202. REPORT AND GUIDANCE ON UNREGULATED CUS-

TODY TRANSFERS. 

(a)  SENSE OF CONGRESS.It  is  the  sense  of  Con-

gress that: 

(1)  Some  adopted  children  may  be  at  risk  of 

experiencing  an  unregulated  custody  transfer  be-

cause  the  challenges  associated  with  adoptions  (in-

cluding  the  childs  mental  health  needs  and  the  dif-

ficulties  many  families  face  in  acquiring  support 

services)  may  lead  families  to  seek  out  unregulated 

custody transfers. 

(2)  Some  adopted  children  experience  trauma, 

and  the  disruption  and  placement  in  another  home

by  unregulated  custody  transfer  creates  additional 

trauma and instability for children. 

(3)  Children  who  experience  an  unregulated 

custody  transfer  may  be  placed  with  families  who 

have  not  completed  required  child  welfare  or  crimi-

nal background checks or clearances. 

(4)  Social  services  agencies  and  courts  are 

often  unaware  of  the  placement  of  children  through 

unregulated  custody  transfer  and  therefore  do  not 

conduct  assessments  on  the  childs  safety  and  well- 

being in such placements. 

(5)  Such  lack  of  placement  oversight  places  a 

child  at  risk  for  future  abuse  and  increases  the 

chance that the child may experience 

(A) abuse or neglect; 

(B)  contact  with  unsafe  adults  or  youth; 

and 

(C)  exposure  to  unsafe  or  isolated  envi-

ronments. 

(6) The caregivers with whom a child is placed 

through  unregulated  custody  transfer  often  have  no 

legal  responsibility  with  respect  to  such  child,  plac-

ing  the  child  at  risk  for  additional  unregulated  cus-

tody transfers.

(7)  Such  caregivers  also  may  not  have  com-

plete  records  with  respect  to  such  child,  including 

the childs birth, medical, or immigration records. 

(8)  A  child  adopted  through 

intercountry 

adoption  may  be  at  risk  of  not  acquiring  United 

States  citizenship  if  an  unregulated  custody  transfer 

occurs  before  the  adoptive  parents  complete  all  nec-

essary steps to finalize the adoption of such child. 

(9)  Engaging  in,  or  offering  to  engage  in,  un-

regulated  custody  transfer  places  children  at  risk  of 

harm. 

(b) REPORT TO CONGRESS. 

(1) IN GENERAL.Not later than 1 year after 

the  date  of  the  enactment  of  this  section,  the  Sec-

retary  of  Health  and  Human  Services  shall  provide

year. 

(2)  DETERMINATION OF CURRENT FUNDED 

RATIO AND PROJECTED FUNDED RATIO.For  pur-

poses of this section:

rent  funded  ratio  is  the  ratio  (expressed  as  a 

percentage) of 

(i)  the  value  of  the  plans  assets  as 

of the first day of the plan year; to 

(ii)  the  plan  actuarys  best  estimate 

of  the  present  value  of  the  plan  liabilities 

as of the first day of the plan year. 

(B)  PROJECTED FUNDED RATIO.The 

projected  funded  ratio  is  the  current  funded 

ratio  projected  to  the  first  day  of  the  fifteenth 

plan  year  following  the  plan  year  for  which  the 

determination is being made. 

(3)  CONSIDERATION OF CONTRIBUTION RATE 

INCREASES.For  purposes  of  projections  under  this 

subsection,  the  plan  sponsor  may  anticipate  con-

tribution  rate  increases  beyond  the  term  of  the  cur-

rent collective bargaining agreement and any agreed- 

to supplements, up to a maximum of 2.5 percent per 

year,  compounded  annually,  unless  it  would  be  un-

into account the experience of the plan and rea-

sonable expectations); 

(B) which, in combination, offer the actu-

arys  best  estimate  of  anticipated  experience 

under the plan; and 

(C)  with  respect  to  which  any  change 

from  the  actuarial  assumptions  and  methods 

used  in  the  previous  plan  year  shall  be  certified

ures,  including  options  or  a  range  of  options  to 

be  undertaken  by  the  plan  sponsor  or  proposed

jected  funded  ratio  of  at  least  120  percent  for 

the  following  plan  year,  such  reasonable  meas-

ures may also include 

(i)  a  reduction  of  accrued  benefits

and  (C)  will  not  enable  the  plan  to  achieve  a 

projected  funded  ratio  of  at  least  120  percent

adopted in a single amendment are treated as a sin-

gle  benefit  increase,  irrespective  of  whether  the  in-

creases  and  new  benefits  take  effect  in  more  than 

one plan year; and 

(3)  increases  in  contributions  or  decreases  in 

plan  liabilities  which  are  scheduled  to  take  effect  in 

future  plan  years  may  be  taken  into  account  in  con-

nection  with  a  plan  amendment  if  they  have  been 

agreed  to  in  writing  or  otherwise  formalized  by  the 

date the plan amendment is adopted.

paragraph  (A),  the  determination  of  the  transi-

tion  contribution  rate  for  a  plan  year  shall  be

poses of this section 

(1)  if  two  or  more  plan  amendments  increas-

(3)  increases  in  contributions  or  decreases  in 

plan  liabilities  which  are  scheduled  to  take  effect  in 

future  plan  years  may  be  taken  into  account  in  con-

the  first  calendar  quarter  beginning  after 

the  close  of  the  first  regular  session  of  the 

State  legislature  that  begins  after  the  date

TITLE  VICOVID19  COMPAS-
SION  AND  MARTHA  WRIGHT 
PRISON PHONE JUSTICE 

SEC. 601. FINDINGS. 

Congress finds the following: 

(1)  Prison,  jails,  and  other  confinement  facili-

ties  in  the  United  States  have  unique  telecommuni-

cations needs due to safety and security concerns. 

(2)  Unjust  and  unreasonable  charges  for  tele-

phone and advanced communications services in con-

finement  facilities  negatively  impact  the  safety  and 

security  of  communities  in  the  United  States  by 

damaging relationships between incarcerated persons 

and  their  support  systems,  thereby  exacerbating  re-

cidivism. 

(3) The COVID19 pandemic has greatly inten-

sified  these  concerns.  Jails  and  prisons  have  become 

epicenters  for  the  spread  of  the  virus,  with  incarcer-

ated  persons  concentrated  in  small,  confined  spaces 

and often without access to adequate health care. At 

Cook  County  jail  alone,  hundreds  of  incarcerated 

persons  and  jail  staff  have  tested  positive  for  the 

virus since its outbreak. 

(4)  To  prevent  the  spread  of  the  virus,  many 

jails  and  prisons  across  the  country  suspended  pub-

lic  visitation,  leaving  confinement  facility  commu-

nications  services  as  the  only  way  that  incarcerated 

persons can stay in touch with their families. 

(5)  All  people  in  the  United  States,  including 

anyone  who  pays  for  confinement  facility  commu-

nications services, should have access to communica-

tions  services  at  charges  that  are  just  and  reason-

able. 

(6) Unemployment has risen sharply as a result 

of  the  COVID19  pandemic,  straining  the  incomes 

of  millions  of  Americans  and  making  it  even  more 

difficult  for  families  of  incarcerated  persons  to  pay 

the  high  costs  of  confinement  facility  communica-

tions services. 

(7)  Certain  markets  for  confinement  facility 

communications services are distorted due to reverse 

competition,  in  which  the  financial  interests  of  the 

entity  making  the  buying  decision  (the  confinement 

facility)  are  aligned  with  the  seller  (the  provider  of 

confinement  facility  communications  services)  and 

not  the  consumer  (the  incarcerated  person  or  a 

member  of  his  or  her  family).  This  reverse  competi-

tion occurs because site commission payments to the 

confinement  facility  from  the  provider  of  confine-

ment  facility  communications  services  are  the  chief

criterion  many  facilities  use  to  select  their  provider 

of confinement facility communications services. 

(8)  Charges  for  confinement  facility  commu-

nications services that have been shown to be unjust 

and  unreasonable  are  often  a  result  of  site  commis-

sion  payments  that  far  exceed  the  costs  incurred  by 

the  confinement  facility  in  accommodating  these 

services. 

(9) Unjust and unreasonable charges have been 

assessed  for  both  audio  and  video  services  and  for 

both  intrastate  and  interstate  communications  from 

confinement facilities. 

(10) Though Congress enacted emergency legis-

lation  to  allow  free  communications  in  Federal  pris-

ons  during  the  pandemic,  it  does  not  cover  commu-

nications  to  or  from  anyone  incarcerated  in  State 

and local prisons or jails. 

(11)  Mrs.  Martha  Wright-Reed  led  a  campaign 

for  just  communications  rates  for  incarcerated  peo-

ple for over a decade. 

(12) Mrs. Wright-Reed was the lead plaintiff in 

Wright  v.  Corrections  Corporation  of  America,  CA 

No. 00293 (GK) (D.D.C. 2001).

(13) That case ultimately led to the Wright Pe-

tition  at  the  Federal  Communications  Commission, 

CC Docket No. 96128 (November 3, 2003). 

(14)  As  a  grandmother,  Mrs.  Wright-Reed  was 

forced  to  choose  between  purchasing  medication  and 

communicating with her incarcerated grandson. 

(15)  Mrs.  Wright-Reed  passed  away  on  Janu-

ary 18, 2015, before fully realizing her dream of just 

communications rates for all people.

on housing in the same year; 

(4)  according  to  data  from  the  Department  of 

Labor,  more  than  30  million  people  have  filed  for

which  is  now  considered  a  global  pandemic,  are  ex-

pected  to  negatively  impact  the  incomes  of  poten-

tially  millions  of  renter  households,  making  it  dif-

ficult for them to pay their rent on time; and 

(6) evictions in the current environment would 

increase  homelessness  and  housing  instability  which 

would  be  counterproductive  towards  the  public 

health goals of keeping individuals in their homes to 

the greatest extent possible.

ered dwelling located in such State may not

percent  of  renters  and  4.1  million  homeowners  who 

are struggling to pay their rent and mortgages. 

(2)  According  to  the  Centers  for  Disease  Con-

trol,  long-standing  systemic  health  and  social  in-

equities have put some members of racial and ethnic 

minority groups at increased risk of getting COVID 

19 or experiencing severe illness. 

(3)  Minority-owned  businesses  are  also  facing 

more difficult economic circumstances than others as 

a  result  of  the  COVID19  pandemic.  In  April  2020, 

the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  New  York  reported 

that  minority-  and  women-owned  businesses  were 

not  only  more  likely  to  show  signs  of  limited  finan-

cial  health,  but  also  twice  as  likely  to  be  classified 

as  at  risk  or  distressed  than  their  non-minority 

counterparts. 

(4)  During  the  Coronavirus  2019  (COVID19) 

pandemic,  community  development  financial  institu-

tions  (CDFIs)  and  minority  depository  institutions 

(MDIs)  have  delivered  needed  capital  and  relief  to 

underserved communities, many of which have borne 

a  disproportionate  impact  of  the  COVID19  pan-

demic.  Through  August  8,  2020,  CDFIs  and  MDIs 

have  provided  more  than  $16.4  billion  in  Paycheck 

Protection Program (PPP) loans to small businesses

compared to the overall program median loan size of 

$101,000. 

(5)  In  addition  to  establishing  relief  funds  and 

services  for  local  businesses  and  individuals  experi-

encing  loss  of  income,  CDFIs  and  MDIs  have  pro-

vided  mortgage  forbearances,  loan  deferments,  and 

modifications  to  help  address  the  needs  of  their  bor-

rowers.  CDFIs  and  MDIs  are  reaching  underserved 

communities  and  minority-owned  businesses  at  a 

critical time. 

(6)  The  Community  Development  Financial  In-

stitutions  Fund  (CDFI  Fund)  is  an  agency  of  the 

U.S.  Department  of  the  Treasury  and  was  estab-

lished  by  the  Riegle  Community  Development  and 

Regulatory  Improvement  Act  of  1994.  The  mission 

of  the  CDFI  Fund  is  to  expand  economic  oppor-

tunity  for  underserved  people  and  communities  by 

supporting  the  growth  and  capacity  of  a  national 

network  of  community  development  lenders,  inves-

tors,  and  financial  service  providers.  As  of  Sep-

tember  15,  2020,  there  were  1,137  certified  CDFIs 

in  all  50  States,  District  of  Columbia,  Guam,  and 

Puerto Rico.

(7)  Following  the  2008  financial  crisis  and  the 

disproportionate  impact  the  Great  Recession  had  on 

minority communities, the number of MDI banks fell 

more  than  30  percent  over  the  following  decade,  to 

143  as  of  the  second  quarter  of  2020.  Meanwhile, 

MDI  credit  unions  have  seen  similar  declines,  with 

more  than  one-third  of  such 

institutions  dis-

appearing since 2013. 

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.The following is the sense 

of the Congress: 

(1)  The  Department  of  the  Treasury,  Board  of 

Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System,  Small 

Business Administration (SBA), Office of the Comp-

troller  of  the  Currency,  Federal  Deposit  Insurance 

Corporation,  National  Credit  Union  Administration, 

and other Federal agencies should take steps to sup-

port, engage with, and utilize minority depository in-

stitutions  and  community  development  financial  in-

stitutions  in  the  near  term,  especially  as  they  carry 

out  programs  to  respond  to  the  COVID19  pan-

demic, and the long term. 

(2)  The  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Re-

serve  System  should,  consistent  with  its  mandates, 

work  to  increase  lending  by  minority  depository  in-

stitutions  and  community  development  financial  in-

stitutions to underserved communities, and when ap-

propriate,  should  work  with  the  Department  of  the 

Treasury  to  increase  lending  by  minority  depository 

institutions  and  community  development  financial 

institutions to underserved communities. 

(3)  The  Department  of  the  Treasury  and  pru-

dential  regulators  should  establish  a  strategic  plan 

identifying  concrete  steps  that  they  can  take  to  sup-

port existing minority depository institutions, as well 

as  the  formation  of  new  minority  depository  institu-

tions consistent with the goals established in the Fi-

nancial  Institutions  Reform,  Recovery,  and  Enforce-

ment  Act  of  1989  (FIRREA)  to  preserve  and  pro-

mote minority depository institutions. 

(4) Congress should increase funding and make 

other enhancements, including those provided by this 

legislation, to enhance the effectiveness of the CDFI 

Fund,  especially  reforms  to  support  minority-owned 

and  minority  led  CDFIs  in  times  of  crisis  and  be-

yond. 

(5)  Congress  should  conduct  robust  and  ongo-

ing  oversight  of  the  Department  of  the  Treasury, 

CDFI  Fund,  Federal  prudential  regulators,  SBA, 

and  other  Federal  agencies  to  ensure  they  fulfill 

their  obligations  under  the  law  as  well  as  implement

seling  and  education  necessary  to  conduct  trans-

actions and manage their accounts. These loans pro-

vide  low-cost  alternatives  to  payday  loans  and  other 

nontraditional  forms  of  financing  that  often  impose 

excessive  interest  rates  and  fees  on  borrowers,  and 

lead  millions  of  Americans  to  fall  into  debt  traps.

terms,  conditions,  and  practices  that  are  reasonable 

for the individual consumer obtaining the loan.

listed  in  section  501(c)(3)  of  the  Internal  Revenue 

Code  and  exempt  from  tax  under  501(a)  of  such 

Code,  federally  insured  depository  institutions,  com-

munity  development  financial  institutions  and  State,

awarded  over  $3,300,000,000  to  CDFIs  and  CDEs, 

allocated  $54,000,000,000 

in 

tax  credits,  and 

$1,510,000,000  in  bond  guarantees.  According  to 

the  CDFI  Fund,  some  programs  attract  as  much  as 

$10  in  private  capital  for  every  $1  invested  by  the 

CDFI  Fund.  The  Administration  and  the  Congress 

should  prioritize  appropriation  of  funds  for  the  loan

support  the  issuance  of  a  special  allocation  of  not

Special  Drawing  Rights  to  the  Poverty  Reduction 

and  Growth  Facility  (PRGF)  or  a  similar  special

SEC. 202. FINDINGS. 

Congress finds the following: 

(1)  In  December  2009,  President  Obama  re-

leased the National Strategy for Countering Biologi-

cal  Threats,  which  listed  as  one  of  seven  objectives 

Promote  global  health  security:  Increase  the  avail-

ability  of  and  access  to  knowledge  and  products  of 

the  life  sciences  that  can  help  reduce  the  impact 

from  outbreaks  of  infectious  disease  whether  of  nat-

ural, accidental, or deliberate origin. 

(2)  In  February  2014,  the  United  States  and 

nearly  30  other  nations  launched  the  Global  Health 

Security  Agenda  (GHSA)  to  address  several  high- 

priority,  global 

infectious  disease  threats.  The 

GHSA is a multi-faceted, multi-country initiative in-

tended  to  accelerate  partner  countries  measurable 

capabilities to achieve specific targets to prevent, de-

tect,  and  respond  to 

infectious  disease  threats, 

whether  naturally  occurring,  deliberate,  or  acci-

dental. 

(3)  In  2015,  the  United  Nations  adopted  the 

Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  which  in-

clude  specific  reference  to  the  importance  of  global 

health  security  as  part  of  SDG  3  ensure  healthy 

lives  and  promote  well-being  for  all  at  all  ages  as 

follows:  strengthen  the  capacity  of  all  countries,  in

particular  developing  countries,  for  early  warning, 

risk  reduction  and  management  of  national  and 

global health risks. 

(4)  On  November  4,  2016,  President  Obama 

signed  Executive  Order  13747, 

Advancing  the 

Global  Health  Security  Agenda  to  Achieve  a  World 

Safe  and  Secure  from  Infectious  Disease  Threats. 

(5)  In  October  2017  at  the  GHSA  Ministerial 

Meeting  in  Uganda,  the  United  States  and  more 

than  40  GHSA  member  countries  supported  the 

Kampala  Declaration  to  extend  the  GHSA  for  an 

additional 5 years to 2024. 

(6)  In  December  2017,  President  Trump  re-

leased  the  National  Security  Strategy,  which  in-

cludes  the  priority  action:  Detect  and  contain  bio-

threats  at  their  source:  We  will  work  with  other 

countries  to  detect  and  mitigate  outbreaks  early  to 

prevent  the  spread  of  disease.  We  will  encourage 

other countries to invest in basic health care systems 

and  to  strengthen  global  health  security  across  the 

intersection  of  human  and  animal  health  to  prevent 

infectious disease outbreaks. 

(7)  In  September  2018,  President  Trump  re-

leased  the  National  Biodefense  Strategy,  which  in-

TITLE IIISECURING AMERICA 

FROM EPIDEMICS ACT 

SEC. 301. FINDINGS. 

Congress finds the following: 

(1)  Due  to  increasing  population  and  popu-

lation  density,  human  mobility,  and  ecological 

change, emerging infectious diseases pose a real and 

growing threat to global health security. 

(2)  While  vaccines  can  be  the  most  effective 

tools  to  protect  against  infectious  disease,  the  ab-

sence  of  vaccines  for  a  new  or  emerging  infectious 

disease  with  epidemic  potential  is  a  major  health  se-

curity  threat  globally,  posing  catastrophic  potential 

human and economic costs. 

(3)  The  1918 

influenza  pandemic 

infected 

500,000,000  people,  or  about  one-third  of  the

worlds  population  at 

the 

time,  and  killed 

50,000,000  peoplemore  than  died  in  the  First 

World War. 

(4)  The  economic  cost  of  an  outbreak  can  be 

devastating.  The  estimated  global  cost  today,  should 

an  outbreak  of  the  scale  of  the  1918  influenza  pan-

demic  strike,  is  5  percent  of  global  gross  domestic 

product. 

(5) Even regional outbreaks can have enormous 

human  costs  and  substantially  disrupt  the  global 

economy  and  cripple  regional  economies.  The  2014 

Ebola  outbreak  in  West  Africa  killed  more  than 

11,000  and  cost  $2,800,000,000  in  losses  in  the  af-

fected countries alone. 

(6)  The  ongoing  novel  coronavirus  outbreak  re-

flects  the  pressing  need  for  quick  and  effective  vac-

cine and countermeasure development. 

(7)  While  the  need  for  vaccines  to  address 

emerging epidemic threats is acute, markets to drive 

the  necessary  development  of  vaccines  to  address 

thema  complex  and  expensive  undertakingare 

very  often  critically  absent.  Also  absent  are  mecha-

nisms  to  ensure  access  to  those  vaccines  by  those 

who need them when they need them.

(8)  To  address  this  global  vulnerability  and  the 

deficit  of  political  commitment,  institutional  capac-

ity,  and  funding,  in  2017,  several  countries  and  pri-

vate  partners  launched  the  Coalition  for  Epidemic 

Preparedness  Innovations  (CEPI).  CEPIs  mission 

is  to  stimulate,  finance,  and  coordinate  development 

of  vaccines 

for  high-priority,  epidemic-potential 

threats  in  cases  where  traditional  markets  do  not 

exist or cannot create sufficient demand. 

(9)  Through  funding  of  partnerships,  CEPI 

seeks  to  bring  priority  vaccines  candidates  through 

the end of phase II clinical trials, as well as support 

vaccine  platforms  that  can  be  rapidly  deployed 

against emerging pathogens. 

(10)  CEPI  has  funded  multiple  partners  to  de-

velop 

vaccine 

candidates 

against 

the  novel 

coronavirus,  responding  to  this  urgent,  global  re-

quirement. 

(11)  Support  for  and  participation  in  CEPI  is 

an  important  part  of  the  United  States  own  health 

security  and  biodefense  and  is  in  the  national  inter-

est,  complementing  the  work  of  many  Federal  agen-

cies  and  providing  significant  value  through  global 

partnership and burden-sharing.

TITLE IIPRISONS AND JAILS 

SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE. 

This title may be cited as the Pandemic Justice Re-

sponse Act. 

SEC. 202. EMERGENCY COMMUNITY SUPERVISION ACT. 

(a) FINDINGS.Congress finds the following: 

(1)  As  of  the  date  of  introduction  of  this  Act, 

the  novel  coronavirus  has  spread  to  all  50  States, 

the  District  of  Columbia,  and  at  least  4  territories. 

(2)  As  of  September  27,  2020,  more  than 

7,119,400  people  in  the  United  States  had  been  in-

fected with the coronavirus and at least 204,400 had 

died. 

(3)  Although  the  United  States  has  less  than  5 

percent  of  the  worlds  population,  the  United  States 

holds  approximately  21  percent  of  the  worlds  pris-

oners  and  leads  the  world  in  the  number  of  individ-

uals  incarcerated,  with  nearly  2,200,000  people  in-

carcerated  in  State  and  Federal  prisons  and  local 

jails. 

(4) Studies have shown that individuals age out 

of  crime  starting  around  25  years  of  age,  and  re-

leased individuals over the age of 50 have a very low 

recidivism rate. 

(5) According to public health experts, incarcer-

ated  individuals  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  being 

gravely impacted by the novel corona virus pandemic 

because 

(A)  they  have  higher  rates  of  underlying 

health  issues  than  members  of  the  general  pub-

lic, including higher rates of respiratory disease, 

heart  disease,  diabetes,  obesity,  HIV/AIDS, 

substance abuse, hepatitis, and other conditions 

that suppress immune response; and 

(B)  the  close  conditions  and  lack  of  access 

to hygiene products in prisons make these insti-

tutions 

unusually 

susceptible 

to 

viral 

pandemics. 

(6)  The  spread  of  communicable  disease  in  the 

United States generally constitutes a serious, height-

ened threat to the safety of incarcerated individuals, 

and  there  is  a  serious  threat  to  the  general  public 

that  prisons  may  become  incubators  of  community 

spread of communicable viral disease.

represented  by  counsel,  the  attorney  for 

the  Government  shows  by  clear  and  con-

vincing  evidence  based  on  individualized 

facts  that  detention  is  necessary  because 

the  juveniles  release  will  pose  a  specific 

and  substantial  risk  that  the  juvenile  will 

use violent force against a reasonably iden-

tifiable  person  and  that  no  conditions  of 

release  will  reasonably  mitigate  that  risk, 

except  that  in  no  case  may  a  judicial  offi-

cer  order  the  detention  of  a  juvenile  if  it 

will  compromise  the  juveniles  access  to

EMERGENCY RESPONSE 

SEC. 3061. FINDINGS; PURPOSES. 

(a)  IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF VULNERABLE AND 

LOW-RISK INDIVIDUALS.The  purpose  of  the  grant  pro-

gram under section 3062 is to provide for the testing, ini-

tiation  and  transfer  to  treatment  in  the  community,  and

(A)  With  the  dramatic  growth  in  pretrial 

detention  resulting  in  county  and  city  correc-

tional  facilities  regularly  exceeding  capacity, 

such  correctional  facilities  may  serve  to  rapidly 

increase  the  spread  of  COVID19,  as  facilities 

that  hold 

large  numbers  of 

individuals 

in 

congregant  living  situations  may  promote  the 

spread of COVID19.

(B)  While  individuals  arrested  and  proc-

essed  at  local  correctional  facilities  may  only  be

TITLE IVJABARA-HEYER NO 

HATE ACT 

SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE. 

This  title  may  be  cited  as  the  Jabara-Heyer  Na-

tional Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equal-

ity  Act  of  2020  or  the  Jabara-Heyer  NO  HATE  Act. 

SEC. 402. FINDINGS. 

Congress finds the following: 

(1)  The  incidence  of  violence  known  as  hate 

crimes  or  crimes  motivated  by  bias  poses  a  serious 

national problem. 

(2)  According  to  data  obtained  by  the  Federal 

Bureau  of  Investigation,  the  incidence  of  such  vio-

lence  increased  in  2017,  the  most  recent  year  for 

which data is available. 

(3)  In  1990,  Congress  enacted  the  Hate  Crime 

Statistics  Act  (Public  Law  101275;  28  U.S.C.  534 

note)  to  provide  the  Federal  Government,  law  en-

forcement agencies, and the public with data regard-

ing  the  incidence  of  hate  crime.  The  Hate  Crimes 

Statistics  Act  and  the  Matthew  Shepard  and  James 

Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E of 

Public  Law  11184;  123  Stat.  2835)  have  enabled 

Federal authorities to understand and, where appro-

priate, investigate and prosecute hate crimes.

(4)  A  more  complete  understanding  of  the  na-

tional  problem  posed  by  hate  crime  is  in  the  public 

interest  and  supports  the  Federal  interest  in  eradi-

cating  bias-motivated  violence  referenced  in  section 

249(b)(1)(C) of title 18, United States Code. 

(5)  However,  a  complete  understanding  of  the 

national  problem  posed  by  hate  crimes  is  hindered 

by  incomplete  data  from  Federal,  State,  and  local 

jurisdictions  through  the  Uniform  Crime  Reports 

program  authorized  under  section  534  of  title  28, 

United  States  Code,  and  administered  by  the  Fed-

eral Bureau of Investigation. 

(6)  Multiple  factors  contribute  to  the  provision 

of  inaccurate  and  incomplete  data  regarding  the  in-

cidence  of  hate  crime  through  the  Uniform  Crime 

Reports program. A significant contributing factor is 

the  quality  and  quantity  of  training  that  State  and 

local  law  enforcement  agencies  receive  on  the  identi-

fication  and  reporting  of  suspected  bias-motivated 

crimes. 

(7)  The  problem  of  crimes  motivated  by  bias  is 

sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in na-

ture  as  to  warrant  Federal  financial  assistance  to 

States and local jurisdictions.

during 

the  emergency  period  described

utility,  as  such  term  is  defined  in  section  3  of  the  Public 

Utility  Regulatory  Policies  Act  of  1978,  and  the  term 

public  water  system  has  the  meaning  given  that  term 

in section 1401 of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Nothing 

in  this  section  shall  be  construed  to  require  forgiveness 

of  any  debt  incurred  or  owed  to  an  entity  or  to  absolve

interests of agriculture; and 

(B) by adding at the end the following: 

(6)  In  the  case  of  an  emergency  posing  a  sig-

nificant  risk  to  the  health  of  humans,  the  Secretary 

of  the  Interior  may  designate  a  species  by  interim 

final  rule.  At  the  time  of  publication  of  the  regula-

tion  in  the  Federal  Register,  the  Secretary  shall 

publish  therein  detailed  reasons  why  such  regulation 

is  necessary,  and  in  the  case  that  such  regulation 

applies  to  a  native  species,  the  Secretary  shall  give 

actual  notice  of  such  regulation  to  the  State  agency 

in  each  State  in  which  such  species  is  believed  to 

occur.  Any  regulation  promulgated  under  the  au-

thority  of  this  paragraph  shall  cease  to  have  force 

and  effect  at  the  close  of  the  365-day  period  fol-

lowing  the  date  of  publication  unless,  during  such 

365-day  period,  the  rulemaking  procedures  which 

would  apply  to  such  regulation  without  regard  to 

this  paragraph  are  complied  with.  If  at  any  time 

after  issuing  an  emergency  regulation  the  Secretary 

determines, on the basis of the best appropriate data 

available  to  the  Secretary,  that  substantial  evidence 

does  not  exist  to  warrant  such  regulation,  the  Sec-

retary shall withdraw it.
