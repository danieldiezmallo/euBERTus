Safeguarding 
Americas First 
Responders Act 
of 2020. 
34 USC 10281 
note. 

To extend public safety officer death benefits to public safety officers whose death 

is caused by COVID19, and for other purposes. 

Be  it  enacted  by  the  Senate  and  House  of  Representatives  of 

the United States of America in Congress assembled, 

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 

This  Act  may  be  cited  as  the  Safeguarding  Americas  First 

Responders Act of 2020. 

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSE. 

exists; 

(a)  SENSE OF CONGRESS.It  is  the  sense  of  Congress  that 
(1)  an  infectious  disease  pandemic  known  as  COVID19 

(2)  to  date,  there  is  much  still  unknown  about  COVID 
19,  but  it  is  known  that  COVID19  and  related  complications 
may be fatal; 

(3)  services  provided  by  public  safety  officers  are  nonethe-

less essential during this pandemic; 

(4)  due  to  the  COVID19  pandemic  and  what  is  currently 
known  about  how  the  disease  is  spread,  public  safety  officers 
are  uncharacteristically  at  risk  of  contracting  the  disease;  and 
(5)  although  the  Public  Safety  Officers  Benefits  program 
currently  covers  deaths  and  permanent  and  total  disabilities 
resulting  from  infectious  disease  sustained  by  public  safety 
officers in carrying out their duties, the determination of claims 
involving  personal  injuries  believed  to  have  resulted  from 
COVID19  or  its  complications  may  be  uniquely  challenging 
or delayed given the lack of 

(A) definitive testing and medical records at this time; 

and 

(B)  a  definitive  uniform  body  of  medical  information 

about how the disease is spread or its effects. 

(b) PURPOSE.The purpose of this Act is to establish a carefully 
drawn framework wherein claims under the Public Safety Officers 
Benefits program, arising under the unique circumstances described 
in  subsection  (a),  can  be  processed  expeditiously  and  under  fair 
and clear standards.

SEC. 3. PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER BENEFITS. 

(a) DEATH BENEFITS.As determined by the Bureau of Justice 
Assistance, unless competent medical evidence establishes that the 
death  of  a  public  safety  officer  (as  defined  in  section  1204  of  title 
I  of  the  Omnibus  Crime  Control  and  Safe  Streets  Act  of  1968
