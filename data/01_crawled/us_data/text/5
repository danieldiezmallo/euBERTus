conditions  or  limitations,  the  Secretary  shall  establish  a  pre-

associated  applications  for  dependents  of  the  beneficiaries 
of such petitions;

mium  processing  by  the  Secretary  on  or  before  August 
1,  2020,  the  premium  fee  shall  be  $2,500,  except  that

posed premium fee amount. 

(C) BIENNIAL ADJUSTMENT.The Secretary may adjust 
a premium fee under subparagraph (A) or (B) on a biennial

June  preceding  the  date  on  which  such  adjustment  takes 
effect  exceeds  the  Consumer  Price  Index  for  All  Urban 
Consumers  for  the  same  month  of  the  second  preceding

tions  processes  and  the  provision  of  information  and  serv-
