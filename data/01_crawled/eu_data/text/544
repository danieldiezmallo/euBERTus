Introduction

            

               
The purpose of Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 10 for the year 2020 is threefold:

            

               
§
to increase the level of payment appropriations in line with the updated forecast and after having taken into account the redeployments proposed in the "Global transfer" (DEC 16/2020 submitted to Parliament and Council early October); 

            

               
§
to adjust the revenue side to incorporate the impact of exchange rate differences and additional fines collected; and

            

               
§
to budget further more limited expenditure adjustements. They concern the level of appropriations of the European Agriculture Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and some decentralised agencies (ESMA, EIOPA, EBA and ELA).

            

               
The overall increase in payment appropriations (EUR 1 569,3 million) requested concerns headings 1a 
'Competitiveness for Growth and Jobs', 
1b
 'Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion'
, 2 
'Sustainable Growth – Natural Resources'
 and 4 
'Global Europe'
. 

            

               
The increase of commitment appropriations in heading 2 is slighlty rebalanced by savings in heading 1a agencies resulting in an overall increase in commitments of EUR 36,4 million.

            

               
The overall impact on the revenue side is a decrease of other revenue by EUR 588 million rebalanced by a corresponding increase in the GNI contributions.

            

               
2.
Additional needs in payment appropriations

            

               
The “Global transfer” is an annual exercise organised at corporate level within the Commission for which all Directorates Generals and Services are requested to review by early September their respective payment implementation of the current budget until the end of the year concerned. This exercise aims to ensure maximum implementation of the budget in payment appropriations at the end of the year by matching additional needs with expected under-implementation. An ad hoc request for transfer (under Article 31 of the Financial Regulation) is annually submitted to Parliament and Council in early October as a result.

            

               
DAB No8 for the year 2020, tabled by the Commission at the end of August, was decoupled from the ‘Global transfer exercise’ and included only requests for which urgent action from the Union was requested. Therefore DAB No8, which proposed a significant request for additional payment appropriations (i.e. EUR 6 190 million), focused exclusively on two specific elements: provide additional payment appropriations (i) to the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) to finance the COVID-19 vaccines strategy and (ii) for cohesion following the adoption of the Corona Response Investment Initiative Plus (CRII+)

                  

               
.

            

               
In addition to the requests included in DAB No8, the 2020 ‘Global transfer’ exercise resulted in additional gross payment needs of EUR 2 125,2 million, only partially offset by expected payment under-implementation of EUR 595,4 million. The additional payments requested in this DAB No10 aims at closing the gap of EUR 1 529,8 million as detailed under the  sections 2.1 through 2.4.

            

               
2.1.
Competitiveness of enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises (COSME)

            

               
As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, many Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) across the Union experienced a sudden lack of liquidity. As announced in the Communication

                  

               
 of 13 March 2020 on the coordinated economic response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Commission decided to redirect EUR 1 billion from the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI) to existing guarantee facilities. As part of this initiative, the Loan Guarantee Facility within COSME was reinforced by EUR 714 million to incentivise banks to provide liquidity finance to companies with the aim of helping at least 100 000 European businesses to access around EUR 8 billion of financing.

            

               
The implementing partner, the European Investment Fund (EIF), published a revised call for expression of interest for financial intermediaries to apply for the specific COVID measure, which was successfully closed end of May this year. This reinforcement results in an increased need for payment appropriations as any cash-needs by the EIF have to be paid first through the COSME Loan Guarantee Facility (the first-loss piece) before cash-calls are being made under EFSI (the second-loss piece). 

            

               
Internal redeployments have partially covered these unforeseen needs but additional payment appropriations of EUR 93,8 million are needed to allow the European Commission to honour its contractual obligations vis-à-vis the EIF.

2.2.
Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) — CF contribution

            

               
The implementation of the cohesion strand of the Connecting Europe facility for Transport (CEF-CF) is progressing faster than expected and the payment needs for the rest of the year exceed the current availabilities. 

            

               
Beneficiaries have an obligation to submit an interim payment claim every two years and have the possibility to submit a “voluntary” interim payment claim every year. In 2020, several large beneficiaries used this flexibility and submitted more interim payment claims than the average pattern observed in previous years. This fast implementation pace was not initially foreseen in the 2020 budget and constitutes the main reason for the increased payment needs.

            

               
The Commission performed an in-depth action-by-action analysis of the payments needs and current budget availabilities, taking into account a redeployment of available payment appropriations within the chapter CEF Transport, and considers that a reinforcement of EUR 100 million in payment appropriations is needed in order to respect the payment deadlines  and honour all legal obligations.

2.3.
European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD)

            

               
The COVID-19 crisis has not slowed down the financial implementation of the programmes financed by the EAFRD. 

            

               
The Commission has performed an in-depth analysis of the forecasts submitted by Member States by the end of August 2020 and considers that a reinforcement of EUR 750 million in payment appropriations is needed in order to cover all expected payment applications to be paid in 2020. These forecasts also include the estimated impact of the lump-sum payment proposed by the Commission to provide relief to farmers or small-medium sized agri-businesses affected by the COVID-19 (based on the finally agreed 2 % maximum share of the Union contribution, as opposed to the 1 % initially proposed by the Commission). Some Member States have in fact already started introducing this new EAFRD measure in their rural development programmes and others are expected to follow. 

            

               
This translates already in 2020 in additional reimbursement requests.

Global EU response to Covid-19

            

               
Following the publication of the joint communication on the Global EU response to Covid-19

                  

               
, where the Union expressed solidarity and commitment to help partner countries deal with the health, economic and social consequences of the crisis as part of the Team Europe efforts, the Commission has reprogrammed its operations under the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA II), the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) and the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI). As a result, there is a need for reinforcement in payment appropriations of these three instruments by EUR 586 million in total as follows:

            

               
2.4.1

                  
   
Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA II)

            

               
For IPA II, budget support payments have been adjusted and advanced, pre-financing and support in indirect management increased in order to speed up implementation.

            

               

            

               
Based on the revised forecasts for payments to be made until the end of 2020, and on top of the redeployments identified, additional appropriations for a total of EUR 210 million are needed to cover payments for contracts for Montenegro, Albania, Kosovo

European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI)

            

               
For ENI, the Commission has modified and increased the budget of on-going programmes in order to speed up their implementation and related payments.

            

               
Besides redeployments already identified as a result of the revised forecasts, additional payment appropriations for a total of EUR 286 million are needed to cover the accelerated disbursements of several budget support programmes for Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, Algeria, Georgia and Armenia as well as for the top up of the envelopes of several other national and regional programmes for the benefit of small and medium sized businesses (for example for resilience and stability in Ukraine East and Armenia).

Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI)

            

               
For DCI, the Commission has accelerated disbursements related to budget support operations in several countries and some funds have been reallocated to new projects specifically to respond to the Covid-19 crisis, for instance in Afghanistan. The related contracts are being signed and will lead to pre-financing payments already in 2020.

            

               
The most urgent needs have already been covered through redeployments, but only partially. Additional payment appropriations for a total of EUR 90 milion are therefore needed to cover accelerated disbursements for Nepal, Myanmar, Cambodia,
 
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.

Other adjustments on expenditure

            

               
3.1.
European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF)

            

               
In the context of exceptional measures to cope with the Covid-19 crisis, the Commission adopted before the summer two packages of measures related to agricultural markets. The first package was dedicated to provide advances and assure smooth functioning of the various direct payment schemes as well as to flexibilise controls. The second package focused on a set of provisions related to market support measures in particular in the fruits and vegetables and wine sectors. 

            

               
With these measures, the Commission has created the conditions for the full use of the EAGF appropriations under the Budget 2020. Both the current level of implementation and recent Member States forecasts support this assumption. 

            

               
The 2020 budget execution of the EAGF is already very advanced, in particular for direct payments showing an even better execution than in previous years. Market related expenditure will be largely concentrated in the very end of the financial year, with still considerable uncertainties on the actual level of spending particularly for the wine programmes, support to producer organisations in the fruit/vegetables sector and the school schemes.

            

               
Based on currently available information, EAGF assigned revenue is expected to be EUR 176 million lower than the budgeted amount. This difference is explained by (a) the settlement of the financial consequences of Court of Justice case C-252/18P in favour of Greece, (b) lower assigned revenue from conformity and clearance of accounts decisions taken by the Commission and (c) the delay of some recoveries to 2021.

            

               
As a result, there is the risk of a small deficit compared to the appropriations currently available in the EAGF budget for 2020, which could be covered by mobilising the remaining margin available under Heading 2.

            

               
Based on the information currently available, and taking into account the forecasts of Member States, the Commission proposes to reinforce the Operational funds for producer organisations budget line under the EAGF as outlined below:

Each instalment paid in a non-euro currency is recorded in the accounts using the monthly exchange rates of the month in which the payment is made.

            

               
For Member States outside the Eurozone the budget is converted into national currency using the exchange rate of the last quotation day of the calendar year preceding the budget year

                  

               
. Thus for 2020, the exchange rate of 31 December 2019 is used to convert the budget from euro into non-euro currencies.

            

               
Therefore any differences in the exchange rates used for calculating the monthly "twelfth" in national currency and the accounting rates applicable in the month of payment of the "twelfth" result inevitably in differences between the own resources amounts in euro foreseen in the budget and the amount actually cashed in.

            

               
Monthly exchange rate fluctuations may compensate each other out during a budget year. However in 2020, the exchange rate development is overall negative. From January to June, a total of minus EUR 400,6 million of exchange rate differences has been registered for own resources and entered in the Amending budget No 7.

            

               
The explanatory memorandum of Amending Budget No 7 highlighted the possibility of further negative exchange rate developments and ensuing additional budgetary amendments proposed to the Budgetary Authority in an autumn draft amending budget.

            

               
Since then (July – September) the evolution of the exchange rate, driven in particular by the depreciation of British pound resulted in an additional deficit of EUR 180 million. In September, the British pound depreciated sharply again. If it remains broadly at the same level as on 1 October, there would be a further exchange rate deficit in own resources of EUR 536 million during the last three months of the year.

            

               
In order to reduce the risk of a budgetary deficit by the end of 2020 an amount of minus EUR 716 million is proposed to be entered in the budget (on top of the already budgeted minus EUR 400,6 million in Amending Budget No 7) to offset exchange rate differences till the end of the year.

Fines and penalty payments

            

               
Taking into account the amounts that have been cashed until the end of September, it is proposed to increase the forecasts introduced in 
the budget 2020 (EUR 218 million

                  

               
)
 by EUR 128 million. This
 will
 reduce accordingly the own resources contributions from Member States to the EU budget.
