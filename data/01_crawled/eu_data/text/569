Conclusions and recommendations

      
1.1.
In view of the COVID-19 crisis, which has led to a virtual halt in sales in 2020, the EESC has examined the European Commission’s proposal for a regulation which would allow Euro 4 motorcycle manufacturers to sell beyond 1 January 2021 vehicles they had in stock on 15 March 2020.
1.2.
This cut-off date restricted the possibility of selling off the entire stock of vehicles that are more polluting than Euro 5 vehicles following the introduction of the mandatory Euro 5 standard on 1 January 2021.
1.3.
The EESC notes that the proposal in no way calls into question the initial introduction of the obligation to sell Euro 5 motorcycles and the ending of Euro 4 vehicle production.
1.4.
The EESC supports the proposal for a regulation, which it deems a fitting and balanced measure to combat the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the costly disposal of Euro 4 vehicle stock.
1.5.
The proposal strikes a balance between ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market, severely disrupted by COVID-19, and continuing efforts to lessen the environmental impact of road transport.

Gist of the Commission proposal

      
2.1.
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the motorcycle sector, provoking a sizeable drop in demand and an increase in vehicles in stock due to the lockdown, given that 60 % of annual sales take place between March and July. This has affected manufacturers’ ability to meet some of the deadlines imposed by Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 
1
 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2013.
2.2.
According to that regulation, the Euro 5 pollutant emissions step will apply on 1 January 2021, which means that only vehicles meeting the Euro 5 requirements can be placed on the Union market as of that date.
2.3.
The end-of-series provisions on L-category vehicles set out in the regulation allow manufacturers to put on the market a limited part of a stock of vehicles no longer eligible for EU type-approval for circulation.
2.4.
While the regulation provides for the possibility for manufacturers to dispose of ‘end-of series’ vehicles, this is limited in each Member State to a maximum of 10 % of the average number of vehicles sold the two preceding years, or a hundred vehicles. According to industry sources, it is estimated that around 553 700 Euro 4 vehicles were in stock in March 2020.
Given the 98 % slump in sales and the number of vehicles in stock, the existing provisions on end-of-series vehicles are not an appropriate mechanism for addressing the situation.
2.5.
The proposal seeks to introduce a derogation that would allow manufacturers, in 2021 only, to place on the market end-of-series Euro 4 vehicles that were in stock at 15 March 2020 and to do so in greater volumes than provided for in the original regulation.
2.6.
While this proposal will mean a delay in ending sales of more polluting vehicles than the new generation, the option will be limited to vehicles that had already been produced at the time of the lockdown. In addition, it avoids unnecessarily scrapping vehicles that would otherwise have been placed on the market had there been no crisis. The proposal will not postpone the entry into force of the Euro 5 step for all newly produced vehicles on 1 January 2021.

General comments

      
3.1.
The EESC reiterates its support for all initiatives that seek to cut pollutant emissions and improve air quality, especially the application of emission standards, known as Euro standards, to the transport sector. It is crucial to limit emissions of pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and microparticles.
3.2.
In its opinion on the proposal for a regulation on the approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles 
2
, adopted unanimously on 19 January 2011, the EESC welcomed the deadline proposed by the European Commission 
3
 for the introduction of the new Euro environmental phases.
3.3.
The EESC recognises that the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a major challenge for the vast majority of European economic sectors and in particular for seasonal markets such as motorcycle sales, which have been particularly hard hit by lockdown measures introduced during the peak season.
3.4.
This situation prevented manufacturers from selling a satisfactory number of Euro 4 vehicles whose validity expires on 31 December 2020. The EESC believes that the provisions on end-of-series vehicles as they currently stand will not give enough support to the motorcycle industry in mitigating the economic impact of the crisis.
3.5.
For this reason, the EESC thinks a proper solution must be found to the difficulties facing the motorcycle sector, one that strikes a balance between the need to sell vehicles in stock since 15 March 2020 and the importance of not delaying the entry into force of the Euro 5 standard on 1 January 2021.
3.6.
The EESC therefore backs the introduction of specific measures for end-of-series L-category vehicles for 2021, which it deems an appropriate and balanced measure to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market while guaranteeing continued efforts to reduce the environmental impact of road transport.
