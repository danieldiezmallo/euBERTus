 provide for such additional conditions, such as the obligation for the applicant to provide documents stating the ‘reference quantity’ of the operator, the origin or the quality of the product.
(7)
In accordance with Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 972/2006, applicants for import licences are to prove that they have been engaged in commercial activity in the rice sector and to provide a product authenticity certificate issued by a competent body in the exporting country.
(8)
During the current pandemic of COVID-19, extensive movement restrictions are put in place in the Member States. Mail and courier services are also experiencing disruptions.
(9)
A number of Member States and stakeholders have informed the Commission that, as a consequence of such restrictions and disruptions, their capacity to provide and receive the official documents required by Regulations governing given import tariff quotas and imports of Basmati rice, is seriously impacted.
(10)
In accordance with Union legislation regulating the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences, and regulating the administration of imports of Basmati rice, applications for import licences and import rights are to be accompanied by originals of those documents.
(11)
Therefore, in order to avoid disruptions of the single market, an alternative to the presentation of original paper official documents should be temporarily authorised. This alternative should be without prejudice to the obligation of operators in accordance with Union legislation to present original documents when technically feasible.
(12)
In order to simplify the administrative procedures for Member States and operators in relation to the licence application during the current pandemic of COVID-19, the obligation for the operators to lodge a higher security where presenting an electronic copy of a certificate of authenticity should be temporarily suspended.
(13)
This Regulation should be applicable until 31 July 2020 in order to facilitate licence application procedures during the current pandemic of COVID-19. In view of the information received from a number of Member States, it is appropriate to provide for temporary measures that should apply immediately. Therefore, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the
