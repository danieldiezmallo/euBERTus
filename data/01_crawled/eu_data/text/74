COUNCIL REGULATION (EU, Euratom) 2020/538
of 17 April 2020
amending Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 laying down the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020 as regards the scope of the Global Margin for Commitments
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 312 thereof,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the consent of the European Parliament,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Acting in accordance with a special legislative procedure,
Whereas:
(1)
The COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, which require extraordinary measures to be taken, have put great pressure on the available financial resources within and outside the multiannual financial framework (MFF) ceilings.
(2)
In order for the Union to be able to finance an appropriate response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis under Council Regulation (EU) 2020/521 
1
, it is necessary to modify the purpose for which the available appropriations under the Global Margin for Commitments can be used, insofar as it refers to growth and employment, in particular youth employment, and to migration and security measures.
(3)
This Regulation is directly linked to financing included in amending budget No 2 to the general budget of the Union for 2020 in the framework of which the Global Margin for Commitments is mobilised to finance measures in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to ensure full coherence with that amending budget, this Regulation should apply from the date of its adoption.
(4)
Article 135(2) of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (‘Withdrawal Agreement’) 
2
 provides that amendments to Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 
3
 that are adopted on or after the date of entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom insofar as those amendments have an impact on the United Kingdom’s financial obligations. Amendments set out in this Regulation are limited to the change of the purpose of the use of the Global Margin for Commitments and do not increase financial obligations. Therefore, it is appropriate to clarify that, for the purposes of Article 135(2) of the Withdrawal Agreement, the amendments set out in this Regulation do not have an impact on the financial obligations of the United Kingdom and, as such, are applicable to the United Kingdom.
(5)
In view of the COVID-19 outbreak and the need to provide financing as a matter of urgency to enable an appropriate response, it was considered appropriate to provide for a derogation from the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.
(6)
Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly,
