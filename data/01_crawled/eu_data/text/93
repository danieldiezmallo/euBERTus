Proposal for a
DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
amending Directive (EU) 2016/797 and Directive (EU) 2016/798, as regards the extension of their transposition period
(Text with EEA relevance)

               
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

            

               
1.
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

            

               
•
Reasons for and objectives of the proposal

            

               
The proposal is part of the emergency measures adopted by the Commission in reaction to the extraordinary situation caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. 

            

               
Unusually, Directive (EU) 2016/797 and Directive (EU) 2016/798 of the technical pillar of the 4th Railway Package provided Member States with a choice of two transposition deadlines

                  

               
 – 16 June 2019, or, upon notification to the Commission and the European Union Agency for Railways, 16 June 2020. Only 8 MS have transposed both Directives in 2019 (BG, FI, FR, GR, IT, NL, RO, SI). 

            

               
In the light of COVID-19 outbreak, most of the remaining 17 Member States have requested a delay to transposition, claiming they will be unable to complete the necessary legislation before 16 June 2020. 

            

               
Given the extraordinary circumstances, it is entirely understandable that final transposition may be impossible before 16 June 2020. It is vital to provide legal clarity and certainty, in particular to the railway industry and undertakings that are the main beneficiaries of the Fourth Railway Package. The COVID-19 outbreak struck in the final stage of adoption of the national transposition measures. Member States should still be able to complete the process in an additional period of three months. Therefore, the Commission considers a short delay of three months to be reasonable.

            

               
A number of implementing acts and delegated acts have been adopted in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/797 and Directive (EU) 2016/798. Given the dual transposition deadline, according transitional provisions and dates for entry into force have been introduced therein. The Commission will propose a set of amendments to the implementing acts to align them with the extension of the transposition deadlines following the adoption of the proposed Directive. For the relevant delegated acts

                  

               
, 
the existing procedure set out in Article 6 of Directive (EU) 2016/798 would not allow an alignment with the extension of the transposition deadlines on time. Thus, 
a legal basis and 
simplified procedure 
for the further alignment is provided in the proposal.
 
This will ensure a coherent legal framework and implementation of the technical pillar of the Fourth Railway Package.

            

               
This is not an initiative within the Regulatory Fitness Programme (REFIT).

            

               
•
Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area

            

                  
The proposals are consistent with the overall emergency measures the Commission is taking to mitigate and overcome negative effects of COVID-19 outbreak. 

               

                  
It is essential to adopt these measures in order to ensure the continuity of the transport of goods and persons.

               

               
•
Consistency with other Union policies

            

               
The effective functioning of the internal market in rail, the free flow of essential goods, passengers and personnel, related services depends on the economic performance of the railway undertakings, infrastructure managers and rail industry, as well as a well-functioning legal and administrative framework. The negative economic consequences of the current COVID-19 outbreak could endanger the financial health of railway undertakings and infrastructure managers and have serious negative effects on the transport system and the economy as a whole. 

            

               
Commission developed a 

               
‘green lanes’

               
 
concept to keep borders open for freight and reduce traffic delays. Guidance on passenger rights has been issued, and will be further updated to address further changes in the overall situation.

            

               
The amendment of the Directives aims to address the major current concerns of Member States, railway undertakings, infrastructure managers and rail industry, and is therefore of utmost importance. 

            

               
2.
LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY

            

               
•
Legal basis

            

               
This initiative is based on Article 91(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 

            

               
•
Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) 

            

               
The objective of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States as they are bound by the transposition arrangements set out in the Directives and cannot unilaterally amend them. This objective may be achieved only through an amendment of the Directives themselves by the co-legislator.

            

               
•
Proportionality

            

               
The proposal is proportionate to the problems created by the crisis and does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective of alleviating the impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak for the purposes of transposition of the Directives.

            

               
•
Choice of the instrument

            

               
In order to achieve its objective, the legal instrument should be of the same form as the one to be amended. The main purpose of the proposal is to amend the transposition deadline as requested by Member States. 

            

               
3.
RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

            

               
•
Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation

            

               
This is an urgent measure which is triggered by the sudden and unforeseeable outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus. For this reason, the measure is not relevant for the regulatory fitness programme and no ex-post evaluation has been carried out.

            

               
•
Stakeholder consultations

            

               
Given the urgency of the matter formal stakeholder consultation could not be carried out. However, both Member States authorities and stakeholders have called upon the Commission to adopt a proposal for appropriate measures in the context of the Directives.

            

               
•
Collection and use of expertise

            

               
As explained, the proper collection of expertise was not possible due to the urgency of the situation. The Commission’s emergency measures are taken on the basis of the scientific evidence on the development of epidemiological circumstances.

            

               
•
Impact assessment

            

               
Given the urgency of the situation, an impact assessment could not be carried out. 

            

               
•
Regulatory fitness and simplification

•
Fundamental rights

            

                  
No impacts on the fundamental rights.

OTHER ELEMENTS

            

               
•
Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements

            

                  
To ensure proper implementation of the proposed measure, which also has a direct impact on the legal clarity to the rail sector, the Commission proposes to introduce a notification clause for Member States opting for the extension of transposition deadline until 16 September 2020.

Proposal for a

            

               
DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

            

               
amending Directive (EU) 2016/797 and Directive (EU) 2016/798, as regards the extension of their transposition period

            

               
(Text with EEA relevance)

            

               
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

            

               
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91(1) thereof,

            

               
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

            

               
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

            

               
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

                  

               
, 

            

               
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions

                  

               
, 

            

               
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

            

               
Whereas:

            

               
(1)
In accordance with Article 57(1) of Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council

                  

               
 and Article 33 (1) of Directive (EU) 2016/798 of the European Parliament and of the Council 

                  

               
 , Member States should have brought their laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the relevant provisions of the Directives by 16 June 2019. However, pursuant to Article 57(2) of Directive (EU) 2016/797 and Article 33(2) of Directive (EU) 2016/798, Member States had the possibility to extend the transposition period by one year.

            

               
(2)
Seventeen Member States have notified the Commission and the European Union Agency for Railways (the 
‘
Agency
’
) about the extension of the transposition deadline of Directives (EU) 2016/797 and (EU) 2016/798 to 16 June 2020.

            

               
(3)
Due to the extraordinary and unforeseeable situation caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, some of those Member States face difficulties to complete the legislative works within the given transposition deadline
 and therefore risk a failure to comply with this deadline
. 
Such a failure
 could create legal uncertainty for the rail industry, the national authorities and the Agency as to 
the legislation that applies 
to rail safety and interoperability. 
The inability of certain 
Member States to transpose the Directives 
as a result of
 the COVID-19 outbreak  ha
s
 detrimental consequences for the rail sector. 

            

               
(4)
It is essential to provide legal clarity and certainty to the rail industry by allowing, where relevant, Member States to continue to apply
,
 as of 16 June 2020 and for a limited period
,
 Directive 2004/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

                  

               
 and Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

                  

               
. 

            

               
(5)
Since the 
COVID-19 outbreak struck in the final stage of adoption of the national transposition measures Member States should be 
allowed
 an additional period of three months to complete the transposition process. 

            

               
(6)
The transposition deadlines of Directives (EU) 2016/797 and (EU) 2016/798 should be extended by three months until 16 September 2020. The repeal dates of Directive 2004/49/EC and Directive 2008/57/EC, as set out in Article 58 of Directive (EU) 2016/797 and Article 34 of Directive (EU) 2016/798 respectively, should be adjusted accordingly.

            

               
(7)
A number of delegated acts have been adopted 
on the basis of
 Directive (EU) 2016/798 reflecting previous transposition deadlines. 
These acts
 need to be aligned with the new transposition deadline in the current situation. 
A 
simplified procedure should be provided where imperative grounds of urgency require an amendment of delegated act. 

            

               
(8)
Directive
s
 
(EU) 2016/797
 
and 
(EU) 2016/798 should be amended accordingly.

            

               
(9)

Official Journal of the European Union
,
