On 16 April 2020, the Political and Security Committee (PSC) agreed that, under the circumstances due to the COVID-19 pandemic, EULEX KOSOVO should be extended by one year with the same mandate, which may be reviewed when circumstances allow.
(4)
EULEX KOSOVO should be granted a financial reference amount for the period of its extension.
(5)
On 14 May 2020, the PSC furthermore agreed that Mr Lars-Gunnar WIGEMARK, who was appointed as Head of Mission on 28 November 2019 by PSC Decision (CFSP) 2019/1991

, should continue to perform this function for a further period of one year.
(6)
Nothing in this Decision should be understood as prejudicing the independence and the autonomy of the judges and prosecutors active in judicial proceedings in the context of EULEX KOSOVO.
(7)
Due to the special character of the activities of EULEX KOSOVO in support of the relocated judicial proceedings within a Member State, it is appropriate to identify in this Decision the amount envisaged to cover the support to those relocated judicial proceedings and to provide for the implementation of that part of the budget through a grant.
(8)
Joint Action 2008/124/CFSP should be amended accordingly.
