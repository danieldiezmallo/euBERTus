COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2020/1351
of 25 September 2020
granting temporary support under Regulation (EU) 2020/672 to the Republic of Latvia to mitigate unemployment risks in the emergency following the COVID-19 outbreak
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EU) 2020/672 of 19 May 2020 on the establishment of a European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE) following the COVID-19 outbreak 
1
, and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1)

(2)
The COVID-19 outbreak and the extraordinary measures implemented by Latvia to contain the outbreak and its socio-economic and health-related impact are expected to have a dramatic impact on public finances. According to the Commission’s 2020 Spring forecast, Latvia was expected to have a general government deficit and debt of 7,3 % and 43,1 % of gross domestic product (GDP) respectively by the end of 2020. According to the Commission’s 2020 Summer interim forecast, Latvia’s GDP is projected to decrease by 7 % in 2020.
(3)
The COVID-19 outbreak has immobilised a substantial part of the labour force in Latvia. This has led to a sudden and severe increase in public expenditure in Latvia in respect of the scheme for the compensation of idle time for workers and the related support schemes – the downtime allowance and the workers’ bonus for children, a scheme for wage subsidies for the export industry, and wage support payments for medical professionals and those employed by the cultural industry – as well as health-related expenditure on protective personal equipment and COVID-19 related sickness benefits, as set out in recitals (4) to (7).
(4)


(5)
The ‘Information report on measures to overcome the COVID-19 crisis and economic recovery’ has established a scheme for wage subsidies for the tourism and export industries, which is a continuation of the scheme for the compensation of idle time for workers aimed specifically at tourism and exporting industries. The measure is dependent on the recipient proving that the resources will be used to cover salary costs.
(6)

(7)

(8)
Latvia fulfils the conditions for requesting financial assistance set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2020/672. Latvia has provided the Commission with appropriate evidence that the actual and planned public expenditure has increased by EUR 212 808 280 as of 1 February 2020 due to the increased amount directly related to the scheme for the compensation of idle time for workers and related support schemes, the scheme for wage subsidies for the export industry, medical professionals and the cultural industry. This constitutes a sudden and severe increase because the new measures cover a significant proportion of undertakings and of the labour force in Latvia. Latvia intends to finance EUR 20 108 280 of the increased amount of expenditure through its own financing.
(9)
The Commission has consulted Latvia and verified the sudden and severe increase in the actual and planned public expenditure directly related to short-time work schemes and similar measures, as well as the recourse to relevant health-related measures related to the COVID-19 outbreak, referred to in the request of 7 August 2020, in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EU) 2020/672.
(10)

(11)
This Decision should be without prejudice to the outcome of any procedures relating to distortions of the operation of the internal market that may be undertaken, in particular under Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty. It does not override the requirement for Member States to notify instances of potential State aid to the Commission under Article 108 of the Treaty.
(12)
Latvia should inform the Commission on a regular basis of the implementation of the planned public expenditure, in order to enable the Commission to assess the extent to which Latvia has implemented that expenditure.
(13)
The decision to provide financial assistance has been reached taking into account existing and expected needs of Latvia, as well as requests for financial assistance pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2020/672 already submitted or planned to be submitted by other Member States, while applying the principles of equal treatment, solidarity, proportionality and transparency,
