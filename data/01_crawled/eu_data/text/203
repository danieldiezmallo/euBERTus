COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) 2020/699
of 25 May 2020
on temporary measures concerning the general meetings of European companies (SEs) and of European Cooperative Societies (SCEs)

            
(Text with EEA relevance)

         
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 352 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the consent of the European Parliament,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Acting in accordance with a special legislative procedure,
Whereas:
(1)

(2)
Such measures can prevent companies and cooperative societies from complying with their legal obligations under national and Union company law, in particular, by making it considerably difficult for them to hold general meetings.
(3)

(4)
At Union level, Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 
1
 regulates European companies (‘SEs’) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1435/2003 
2

(5)
There are no powers conferred by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) for the adoption of this Regulation other than those under Article 352.
(6)
Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to provide a temporary emergency solution for SEs and SCEs enabling them to derogate from the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 and Regulation (EC) No 1435/2003 concerning the timing of the holding of general meetings, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(7)
In view of the fact that the six month period referred to Regulations (EC) No 2157/2001 and (EC) No 1435/2003 will expire in May or June 2020 and given that convening periods will have to be taken into account, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency.
(8)

Article 2
Temporary measure concerning the general meetings of European Cooperative Societies (SCEs)
Where, in accordance with Article 54(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1435/2003, a general meeting of an SCE is to be held in 2020, the SCE may, by way of derogation from that provision, hold the meeting within 12 months of the end of the financial year, provided that the meeting is held by 31 December 2020.
