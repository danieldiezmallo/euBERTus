COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION (EU) 2020/1551
of 22 October 2020
amending Recommendation (EU) 2020/912 on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article Article 77(2)(b) and (e) and Article 292, first and second sentence thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
On 30 June 2020, the Council adopted a Recommendation on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction 
1
 (‘Council Recommendation’). On 16 July 2020, the Council adopted Recommendation (EU) 2020/1052 of 16 July 2020 amending Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/912 on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction 
2
. On 30 July 2020, the Council adopted Recommendation (EU) 2020/1144 of 30 July 2020 amending Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/912 on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction 
3
.
On 7 August 2020, the Council adopted Recommendation (EU) 2020/1186 of 7 August 2020 amending Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/912 on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction 
4
.
(2)
The Council Recommendation provides that Member States should gradually lift the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU as from 1 July 2020 in a coordinated manner with regard to the residents of the third countries listed in Annex I to the Council Recommendation. Every two weeks, the list of third countries referred to in Annex I should be reviewed, and as the case may be updated, by the Council, after close consultation with the Commission and the relevant EU agencies and services following an overall assessment based on the methodology, criteria and information referred to in the Council Recommendation.
(3)
Discussions have since then taken place within the Council, in close consultation with the Commission and the relevant EU agencies and services, on the review of the list of third countries set out in Annex I to the Council Recommendation and in application of the criteria and methodology laid down in the Council Recommendation. As a result of these discussions, the list of third countries set out in Annex I should be amended. In particular, Canada, Georgia and Tunisia should be deleted from the list while Singapore should be added. It should also be clarified that, subject to confirmation of reciprocity, travel should be possible with the Hong Kong SAR and Macao SAR.
(4)
Border control is in the interest not only of the Member State at whose external borders it is carried out but of all Member States which have abolished internal border control. Member States should therefore ensure that measures taken at the external borders are coordinated in order to ensure a well functioning Schengen area. To that end, as of 22 October 2020, Member States should continue lifting the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU in a coordinated manner with regard to the residents of the third countries listed in Annex I of the Council Recommendation as amended by this Recommendation.
(5)
In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the Position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the TFEU, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Recommendation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Recommendation builds upon the Schengen 
acquis
, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Recommendation whether it will implement it.
(6)
This Recommendation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen 
acquis
 in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC 
5
; Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(7)
As regards Iceland and Norway, this Recommendation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen 
acquis
 within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latter’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen 
acquis
 which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC 
6
.
(8)
As regards Switzerland, this Recommendation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen 
acquis
 within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen 
acquis
 which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Decision 1999/437/EC
