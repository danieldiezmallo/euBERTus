COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL AND THE COUNCIL

            

               
COVID-19

                  
Guidance on persons exempted from the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU as regards the implementation of Council Recommendation 2020/912 of 30 June 2020

            

               
I.
Introduction

            

               
On 30 June 2020, the Council adopted Recommendation 2020/912 on the temporary restriction on non-essential travel into the EU and the possible lifting of such restriction

                  

               
. 

            

               
The Recommendation states that where temporary travel restrictions continue to apply to a third country, the following categories of persons should be exempted from the travel restriction, independent of the purpose of travel:

            

               
(a) Union citizens within the meaning of Article 20(1) TFEU and third-country nationals who, under agreements between the Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and those third countries, on the other hand, enjoy rights of free movement equivalent to those of Union citizens, as well as their respective family members; and 

            

               
(b) third-country nationals who are long-term residents under the Long-term Residence Directive persons deriving their right to reside from other EU Directives or national law or who hold national long-stay visas, as well as their respective family members. 

            

               
In addition, essential travel should be allowed for the specific categories of travellers with an essential function or need referred to in Annex II of the Recommendation. 

            

               
Discussions in the Council’s Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR) Working Level Roundtable on 14 September 2020 pointed to a need for further clarification through interpretive guidelines. This guidance is based on input and feedback from the Member States, including from the Council Presidency. 

            

               
This document provides guidance to implement the Council Recommendation with regard to persons exempted from the temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU. In particular, it provides guidance on the interpretation of the term ‘family member’ in the context of the exempted family members of Union citizens or of long-term residents in the EU (part II). 

            

               
In addition, it provides guidance on the specific categories of travellers with an essential function or need listed in Annex II of the Council Recommendation (part III), namely:

            

               
·
the scope of the categories, taking account of the relevant EU acquis; and

            

               
·
the documentation or other evidence that could be requested from third country nationals to prove that they fall under one of the categories. 

            

               
This guidance does not exclude that Member States may consider sufficient also evidence not expressly referred to therein. 

            

               
In its Guidelines on ‘minimum service’ for processing of visa applications from specific categories of visa applicants during the COVID-19 emergency period

                  

               
, the Commission recommended that Member States continue to accept visa applications from essential travellers, including family members covered by the Free Movement Directive 2004/38/EC

                  

               
 (hereinafter the Free Movement Directive).

            

               
II.
Entry for family members (point 5 of the Recommendation)

            

               
1.
Entry for family members of Union citizens (point 5(a) of the Recommendation)

            

               
Scope:
  

            

               
For the definition of the term “family members” of EU citizens, the Council Recommendation refers to Articles 2 and 3 of the Free Movement Directive. The categories of (third country national) family members referred to in these provisions are to be interpreted broadly and are not limited by definitions and notions in national law.

                  

               
  This also applies to the category of partners in a “durable relationship, duly attested”. Accordingly, under the Recommendation Member States should, in particular, facilitate the reunion of duly attested durable partners, regardless of the non-EU citizen’s place of residence. 

            

               
While the Recommendation itself is a soft law instrument, the Free Movement Directive applies to EU citizens who have exercised their right to free movement within the EU, notably when they reside in the territory of another Member State, and their family members.  On that basis, these family members are entitled to accompany or join their relatives in the Member State concerned.

            

               
There are two relevant scenarios for third-country nationals located outside the EU who are family members of an EU citizen:

            

               
a) The EU citizen has exercised his/her right to free movement (notably, when he/she resides in another Member State than his/her Member State of origin):

            

               
As set out above, obligations regarding the entry and residence of family members of mobile EU citizens, including durable partners, already exist based on the Free Movement Directive. Member States therefore cannot limit the corresponding rights when processing the entry of such family members as an implementation of the Council Recommendation.

            

               
The categories of family members listed in Articles 2 and 3 of the Free Movement Directive, to which point 5 of the Council Recommendation refers, are the following.

            

               
Core family members

            

               
Article 2 of the Free Movement Directive defines the term ‘family member” as:

            

               
a)
the spouse;

            

               
b)
the partner with whom the Union citizen has contracted a registered partnership, on the basis of the legislation of a Member State, if the legislation of the host Member State treats registered partnerships as equivalent to marriage and in accordance with the conditions laid down in the relevant legislation of the host Member State;

            

               
c)
the direct descendants who are under the age of 21 or are dependants and those of the spouse or partner as defined in point (b);

            

               
d)
the dependent direct relatives in the ascending line and those of the spouse or partner as defined in point (b).

            

               
Member States have an obligation to admit entry of such family members, including, under the conditions set out in point b), the partner with whom the EU citizen has a registered partnership. 

            

               
Dependent family members

            

               
Furthermore, Article 3 of the Free Movement Directive requires that Member States facilitate, in accordance with their national laws, entry and residence of any other family members than those listed above as “core family members”, irrespective of their nationality, who, in the country from which they have come, are dependants or members of the household of a Union citizen having the primary right of residence, or where serious health grounds strictly require the personal care of the family member by the Union citizen.

            

               
Durable relationships

            

               
Article 3 of the Free Movement Directive also includes the requirement that entry be facilitated, in accordance with Member States’ national legislation, for ‘
the partner with whom the Union citizen has a durable relationship, duly attested’
. 

            

               
As explained in the 2009 Guidance for better transposition and application of Directive 2004/38/EC

                  

               
, such unmarried partners may be required to present documentary evidence that they are partners of an EU citizen and that the relationship is durable. Evidence may be provided by any appropriate means. Possible evidence should include, for example, a joint declaration of the partners, proof of previous meetings and common investments. The requirement of durability of the relationship must be assessed in the light of the objective of the Free Movement Directive to maintain the unity of the family in a broad sense. National rules on durability of the relationship can refer to a minimum amount of time as a criterion for whether it can be considered as durable. However, in this case national rules should foresee that other relevant aspects (such as for example a joint lease or mortgage to rent or buy a home) are also taken into account in the overall assessment

                  

               
. 

            

               
b) When an EU citizen has not exercised free movement rights (notably, when residing in his/her Member State of nationality) 

            

               
In this scenario, national law instead of EU law applies to the entry of third-country national family members of EU citizens, including unmarried partners, as these citizens fall outside the scope of the Free Movement Directive.

            

               
Nonetheless, in accordance with the Recommendation, Member States should treat such family members like those of mobile EU citizens, which should also enable Member States to avoid the additional administrative burden stemming from the need to apply different procedures.

            

               
Possible evidence for unmarried partners
:

            

               
-
joint declaration of the partners on their relationship; 

            

               
-
proof of previous meetings in person (e.g. by passport stamps and travel documents);

            

               
-
minimum duration of the relationship in case national criteria exist in this respect (consideration should be given to the fact that the travel restrictions have been in place for more than six months now and will continue); or

            

               
-
joint lease contract, joint bank account.

            

               
2.
Entry for third-country nationals and their family members (point 5(b) of the Recommendation)

            

               
Point 5(b) of the Council Recommendation should be understood as covering third-country nationals who:

            

               
-
hold a visa or a residence permit issued by a Member State under the EU legal migration acquis, i.e. Directive 2003/86/EC on the right to family reunification, Directive 2003/109/EC on long-term residents, Directive 2009/50/EC on the EU Blue Card, Directive 2014/36/EU on seasonal workers, Directive 2014/66/EU on Intra-corporate transferees and Directive (EU) 2016/801 on students, researchers, trainees, volunteers, school pupils and au pairs. 

            

               
This also implies that third-country nationals, and where applicable, their family members, who fulfil the conditions of admission set in those Directives should be able to submit their applications in order to be granted such a visa or residence permit, and subsequently be exempted from the travel restriction; 

            

               
or

            

               
-
hold a residence permit or a long-stay visa issued by a Member State under its national law. 

            

               
Those third-country nationals should also be allowed to transit through other Member States to reach the Member State that issued the visa or residence permit.

            

               
III.
Specific categories of travellers with an essential function or need – Annex II of Council Recommendation 2020/912

            

               
The list in Annex II of specific categories of travellers with an essential function or need is intended to take into account economic and social considerations that third-country nationals may have for travelling to the EU, as well as the economic and social interest that the EU may have for allowing such third country nationals to enter the EU. Contrary to the list of third countries in Annex I for which the restriction on non-essential travel into the EU can be lifted, the list of categories in Annex II should be applied by Member States in full. 
Member States should allow travel for all the categories listed there, and not only to some of them. 

            

               
The guidance on the categories listed below, as well as on the evidence to be supplied, is not meant to be exhaustive. Member States are encouraged to apply a broad interpretation of both the scope and possible evidence, whilst bearing in mind that the evidence supplied should allow the authorities to establish a direct link to the activities for which access is granted.

Scope:
 Third-country nationals, holding a valid entry permit for the country of destination (e.g. uniform visa), irrespective of their nationality, who need to transit via the EU should be allowed onward transit while travelling to their country of origin or EU country of residence, and allowed a reasonable/realistic duration of transit (an overnight stop might be needed). Given the reduced availability of direct commercial flights, ‘onward transit’ should cover any means of transportation.

            

               
Possible evidence includes
: proof of onward travel, such as a transport ticket, boarding pass. 

            

               
7.
Passengers travelling for imperative family reasons; 

            

               
Scope:
 As no exhaustive list of possible imperative family reasons can be established, this category should be interpreted broadly and assessed on an individual basis. It could, amongst others, include travel for custodial or visiting rights for a child as well as the school attendance of a child, emergency help for a family member, wedding of the travelling person or of a close family member, birth or funeral of a family member.

Persons in need of international protection or for other humanitarian reasons

            

               
Scope:
 The temporary travel restrictions should not apply to persons in need of international protection or for other humanitarian reasons. 

            

               
Temporary travel restrictions should also not apply to persons travelling in order to receive essential medical care.

            

               
As third country nationals should be in a position to apply for international protection upon arrival into the EU, 
no evidence should be required for this category
.  

            

               
For essential medical care, a statement confirming the person’s need for essential medical care from a medical practitioner registered in a Member State, in Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland.

            

               
10.
Third-country nationals travelling for the purpose of study 

            

               
Scope:
 This exception is broadly worded and therefore, does not only cover actual students but all persons travelling in order to pursue studies or training of any kind, if duly justified.   

            

               
This exception must cover students who are defined in Article 3(3) of the EU Students and Researchers Directive 2016/801 as “a third-country national who has been accepted by a higher education institution and is admitted to the territory of a Member State to pursue as a main activity a full-time course of study leading to a higher education qualification recognised by that Member State, including diplomas, certificates or doctoral degrees in a higher education institution, which may cover a preparatory course prior to such education, in accordance with national law, or compulsory training.” 

            

               
The exception may also cover third-country nationals coming for the purpose of study or training but who do not fall under this definition.

            

               
There is no minimum duration as to the length of the studies. In particular, and based on the language used under this point of Annex II, there is no reason to require that the studies must span an entire academic year or semester.

            

               
Possible evidence includes
: proof of enrolment, invitation to enrol, recognised student card or certificate for the courses to attend, a certificate of enrolment at a teaching institute for the purposes of attending vocational or theoretical courses in the framework of basic and further training. 

            

               
11.
Highly qualified third-country workers if their employment is necessary from an economic perspective and the work cannot be postponed or performed abroad   

            

               
Scope:
 This exception covers workers who are third-country nationals and who, because of their high level of skills and expertise, are required in order to contribute to the EU’s post-COVID economic recovery. It may include those whose application for permits under the Blue Card Directive 2009/50, the ICT Directive 2014/66, under Directive 2016/801 as Researchers, or under a national scheme for skilled migrants, was approved, but who were until now prevented from entering the EU due to the entry ban.

            

               
Based on the feedback received from Member States, the following should be included:

            

               
·
professional athletes and their staff for competitions in Member States (even if not employed); 

            

               
·
professional performers/artists, including any technical staff members accompanying professional performers/artists;

            

               
·
international journalists who have to be personally or physically present in order to report current news;

            

               
·
experts, researchers and scientists; and 

            

               
·
