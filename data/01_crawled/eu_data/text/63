COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) 2020/521
of 14 April 2020

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 122(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1)

(2)
In addition to the economic and social impact of the pandemic, the healthcare systems of Member States are severely strained by the crisis. Member States are faced with increased demands in particular for medical equipment and provisions, essential public services and production capacities for such materials.
(3)

(4)

1

(5)
Therefore, it is necessary to activate the emergency support under Council Regulation (EU) 2016/369 
2
.
(6)

3
, that budgetary commitments made during the activation period can be used for concluding legal commitments during the entire duration of the activation period. This should be without prejudice to the obligation to cover also the costs of corresponding legal commitments entered into after the activation period in compliance with the n+1 rule set out in that subparagraph. Costs incurred under such legal commitments should be eligible for the whole period of their implementation.
(7)
In order to ensure equal treatment and a level playing field for Member States, it is necessary to allow for retroactive eligibility of costs as of the date of activation of the emergency support, including for actions already completed, provided they have started after that date.
(8)
In order to preserve the subsidiary nature of emergency support under Regulation (EU) 2016/369, such support should be strictly complementary to any assistance made available under other Union instruments.
(9)

(10)
To alleviate the acute strain on the medical workforce and on State resources due to insufficient capacities of essential public services, and to maintain the viability of the healthcare system, a temporary reinforcement and exchange of medical professionals, as well as the treatment of patients from other Member States, should be supported financially or by organisational means.
(11)
Financial support should also cover training for professionals in healthcare and logistics in view of the fight against counterfeiting of healthcare supplies.
(12)

(13)
In order to address supply shortages, production capacities for essential medical products such as medication, diagnostic tests, laboratory supplies, and protective gear, should be supported and funding should be provided to maintain a stock of those products.
(14)
Additional or alternative testing methods to increase capacity and relevant medical research should be assisted by financial and/or organisational means.
(15)

(16)
For emergency situations, where it is necessary to carry out a joint procurement between the Commission and one or more contracting authorities from Member States, it should be made possible for Member States to acquire, rent or lease fully the capacities jointly procured.
(17)
The Commission should be allowed to buy, stock, resell and donate supplies and services, including rentals, to Member States or partner organisations selected by the Commission.
(18)
Regulation (EU) 2016/369 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(19)
Member States have declared, as parties to the Joint Procurement Agreement referred to in Article 5 of Decision No 1082/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council 
4
, their agreement to the inclusion of ongoing joint procurement procedures under that Article in the fast-track procurement procedure established by this Regulation, under the conditions set out therein. The type of medical countermeasures to be procured and the distribution of the countermeasures to Member States should follow any agreement reached under those ongoing procedures.
(20)

(21)
Those measures will only attain their full potential if the medical countermeasures procured under the fast track and joint procedures reach the health care services in Member States without any delay. Member States should therefore keep essential transport flows moving, in particular through designated priority lanes, green lanes, at border-crossings along the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) and facilitate air cargo operations, during the COVID-19 outbreak. Union Civil Protection Mechanism transport resources should be used as necessary. For this specific purpose, it is necessary to provide for a derogation from Article 1(6) of Decision No 1313/2013/EU.
(22)

(23)
In order to ensure equal treatment and a level playing field for Member States and provide coverage regardless of when the outbreak occurred in a given Member State, this Regulation should apply from 1 February 2020,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
