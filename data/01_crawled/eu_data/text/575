COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2020/1652
of 4 November 2020
amending Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/220 laying down rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1217/2009 setting up a network for the collection of accountancy data on the incomes and business operation of agricultural holdings in the European Union
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1217/2009 of 30 November 2009 setting up a network for the collection of accountancy data on the incomes and business operation of agricultural holdings in the European Union 
1
, and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 5(1), Articles 5a(2), 5b(7), 6(5), 7(2), the third and fourth subparagraphs of Article 8(3) and Article 19(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Article 10 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/220 
2

(2)
Annex IV to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/220 sets out the correspondence between the headings referred to in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/1874 
3
 and the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) farm returns. In that Annex, the terms ‘standard output’ (SO) and ‘standard output coefficient’ (SOC) are defined. Both terms and abbreviations should be indicated in both English and the language of the respective EU official language version. However, in order to facilitate comparison and analysis, Section A ‘Particular types of farming specialisation’ and Section B ‘Table of correspondence and regrouping codes’ in Annex IV should consist of only English abbreviations (SO or SOC). In addition, the wording and the formatting of the Tables of Annex IV should be improved and clarified. It is therefore appropriate to replace Annex IV by a new text.
(3)
Annex VIII to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/220 sets out the form and layout of the accountancy data contained in the farm returns. Three new variables that relate to the Producer Organisations (POs) should be added in Table A of that Annex. The objective of improving the position of farmers in the agri-food chain is supported by various common agricultural policy (CAP) measures. Collecting data on the farmers’ participation in producer organisations will therefore give valuable insight on the effects of the CAP. The proposed new variables should apply to all Member States as from the accounting year 2023. Member States which are unable to submit data for some or all of the three new variables may be exempted if they submit a duly justified request to the Commission before 31 May 2021. On a voluntary basis Member States should have the possibility to submit the data relating to the new variables as from accounting year 2021.
(4)
Annex VIII to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/220 sets out the form and layout of the accountancy data contained in the farm returns. It is necessary to improve terms used in the Table C and Table I of Annex VIII. It is therefore necessary to replace those tables.
(5)
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/220 should therefore be amended accordingly. The proposed amendment should apply as from the accounting year 2021.
(6)
The Committee for the Farm Accountancy Data Network has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its chair,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/220 is amended as follows:
(1)
in Article 10, paragraph 3 the following subparagraph is added:
‘In the case of exceptional circumstances that may disrupt data delivery, the Member States shall promptly inform the Commission about the status of the data collection and data delivery as well as propose a solution for data delivery. After the analysis of information provided, the Commission may exceptionally extend the deadline referred to in the first subparagraph once by maximum 3 months.’;
(2)
Annex IV is replaced by the text set out in Annex I to this Regulation;
(3)
Annex VIII is amended in accordance with the Annex II to this Regulation.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the 
Official Journal of the European Union
.
It shall apply from the accounting year 2021.
However:
(a)
Article 1(1) shall apply from the entry into force of this Regulation as regards the submission of farm returns for the accounting year 2019;
(b)
Article 1(3) as regards the variables A.OT.230.C, A.OT.231.C and A.OT.232.C introduced in Table A of Annex VIII to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/220 shall apply from the accounting year 2023.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
Done at Brussels, 4 November 2020.

ANNEX I
‘ANNEX IV

                        
PARTICULAR TYPES OF FARMING SPECIALISATIONS AND THEIR CORRESPONDENCE WITH GENERAL AND PRINCIPAL TYPES OF FARMING (ARTICLE 4)

                     
The following definitions apply:
(a)

                                    
Standard output (SO)
 is the standard value of gross production. The SO is used for classifying farms according to the Union farm typology (in which the type of farming is defined by main production activities) and for determining economic farm size.
(b)

                                    
Standard output coefficient (SOC)
 is the average monetary value of gross production of each agricultural variable referred to in Article 6(1), corresponding to the average situation in a given region, per unit of production. SOCs are calculated at farm-gate price, in euro per hectare of crop or euro per head of livestock (exceptions apply for mushrooms in euro per 100 m
2
, poultry in euro per 100 heads and bees in euro per hive). VAT, taxes and subsidies are not included in the farm-gate price. SOCs are updated at least every time a European survey on the structure of agricultural holdings is conducted.
(c)

                                    
Total SO of a holding
 is the sum of the individual production units of a specific holding multiplied by their respective SOC.
A.   PARTICULAR TYPES OF FARMING SPECIALISATION
The particular types of farming specialisation are defined by two features:
(a)
The nature of the variables concerned
The variables refer to the relevant list of variables surveyed in the IFS data collections: they are indicated by using the codes presented in the table of correspondence in Part B.I of this Annex or by a code regrouping several of those variables as set out in Part B.II of this Annex 
1
.
(b)
The conditions determining the class limits
Unless otherwise indicated, these conditions are expressed as fractions of the total SO of the holding.
All conditions indicated for particular types of farming specialisation have to be met cumulatively in order for the holding to be classified under the related particular type of farming specialisation.

A.ID.   
Identification of the holding

                        
A number is assigned to each returning holding when it is selected for the first time. The holding retains this number permanently for the duration of its inclusion in the accountancy network. A number once assigned is never allotted to another holding.
However, where the holding undergoes a fundamental change, and in particular where this change is the result of a subdivision into two separate holdings or of a merger with another holding, it may be considered as a new holding. In this case a new number is to be assigned to it. A change in the type of farming practised on the holding does not call for a new number. Where confusion with any other returning holding might result from the holding keeping the number it has (e.g. when new regional subdivisions are created), the number should be changed. A table showing the equivalence of old and new numbers is then to be forwarded to the Commission.
The holding number comprises three groups of indications as follows:
A.ID.10.R
. FADN Division
: a code number is to be given, corresponding to the code set in Annex II to this Regulation.
A.ID.10.S
. Subdivision
: a code number is to be given.
The subdivisions chosen should be based on the common system of classification of the regions, referred to as the nomenclature of territorial statistical units (NUTS) established by Eurostat in cooperation with the national institutes for statistics.
In any case, the Member State concerned will transmit to the Commission a table indicating, for each subdivision code used, the corresponding NUTS regions, as well as the corresponding region for which specific values of standard output are calculated.
A.ID.10.H. 
Serial number of the holding
.
A.LO.   
Location of the holding

The term 'labour' includes all persons who have been engaged on work on the farm during the accounting year. However, this does not include persons who have done this work on behalf of another person or undertaking (agricultural contract work, of which the costs appear in table H under code 1020).
In the case of mutual assistance between holdings, where this assistance consists of an exchange of work, the assistance received being equivalent in principle to the assistance given, the time worked by the farm labour and any related wages are specified in the farm return.
Sometimes assistance received is offset by assistance of another kind (e.g. aid received in the form of work is offset by the supply of machinery). When the exchange of services is on a limited scale, nothing is indicated in the farm return (in the above example, the aid received is not shown under labour; machinery costs, however, include the costs of making the equipment available). In exceptional cases, when the exchange of services is on a large scale, the procedure is one of the following :
(a)
assistance received in the form of work is offset by a service of another kind (e.g. the supply of machinery): working time received is recorded as paid farm work (groups PR or PC depending on whether the labour is employed on the farm on a regular basis or otherwise); the value of the assistance given is recorded both as production under the corresponding category in other tables (in this example, table L code 2010 ‘Contractual work’) and as a cost (table H code 1010 ‘Wages and social security’);
(b)
assistance given in the form of work is offset by a service of another kind (e.g. the supply of machinery): in this situation the working time provided and any related wages are left out of consideration; the value of the service received is recorded as an input under the corresponding group in another table (in this example, table H code 1020 ‘Contract work and machinery hire’).
The following groups of information and categories of labour are to be distinguished:
C.UR.

Unpaid labour or labour which receives less remuneration (in cash or in kind) than the amount normally paid for the services rendered (such payment should not appear in farm costs) and which during the accounting year participated (outside normal holidays) for at least a whole day of each week.
A person employed regularly but who, for special reasons, has been engaged on the farm only for a limited period in the accounting year is nevertheless entered (for the number of hours actually worked) as regular labour.
The following cases or similar ones may arise:
(a)
special production conditions on the farm for which labour is not required throughout the year: e.g. olive or wine holdings, and farms specialising in the seasonal fattening of animals or in the production of fruit and vegetables in the open;
(b)
absence from work other than for normal holidays, e.g. military service, illness, accident, maternity, extended leave, etc.;
(c)
joining or leaving the holding;

Annual time worked
 (column Y1)
Time worked should be indicated in hours for all groups and categories. It should refer to the time actually devoted to the work of the holding. In the case of less able workers the time worked should be reduced in proportion to their capacities. The time worked by piecework labour is estimated by dividing the total amount paid for the work by the hourly wage of a worker employed on a time basis.

                           
Total work force
: 
number of annual units
 (column W1)
Regularly employed work force is converted into annual work units. The number of annual work unit is not recorded for casual labour (both unpaid casual UC and paid casual PC labour). One annual work unit is equivalent to one person working full-time on the holding. One person cannot exceed one work unit equivalent, even if his actual working time exceeds the norm for the region and type of holding. A person who does not work the whole year on the holding represents a fraction of an ‘annual unit’. The ‘annual work unit’ of each such person is obtained by dividing his actual annual working time by the normal annual working time of a full-time worker in the region under consideration and on the same type of holding.
In the case of less able workers the annual work unit equivalent should be reduced in proportion to their capacities.

                           
Share of work for OGA in % of annual time worked
