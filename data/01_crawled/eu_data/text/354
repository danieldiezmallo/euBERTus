•
Reasons for and objectives of the proposal

            

                  
The direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 outbreak continue to increase in all Member States. The current situation is unprecedented and requires measures to support Member States in the implementation of the Funds. In this respect, the full use of the N+2 rule should be ensured so as to provide Member States with sufficient time for the implementation of their allocations and declaration of the expenditure to the Commission.

               

                  
More specifically, in order for the decommitment rule (N+2) to take into account the payment request covering in full the year N+2 submitted by Member States, it is necessary to align the decommitment deadline with the deadline of the submission of the accounts.  

               

                  
In addition, in order to ensure consistency in the approach to decommitment and to provide Member States with an implementation period in line with the N+2 rule, it is proposed to align the decommitment of the additional allocations provided to the national programmes in 2018 and 2019 with the rules applicable to the basic allocation of the national programmes.

Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal

            

               
It is proposed to amend Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 to ensure that all payment requests covering the year N+2 submitted by Member State within the regulatory deadlines set out in Art. 44 of Regulation 514/2014 are taken into account when calculating the decommitment. In addition, it is proposed to amend Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 to ensure that the implementation period of the amounts corresponding to additional allocations to the national programmes provided in 2018 and 2019 is aligned with the implementation period of the initial allocation. Both amendments ensure consistency between provisions and are without prejudice to the N+2 decommitment rule.

Proposal for a

            

               
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

            

               
amending Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council, as regards the decommitment procedure

            

               
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

            

               
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 78(2), Article 79(2) and (4), Article 82(1), Article 84 and Article 87(2) thereof,

            

               
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

            

               
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

            

               
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

                  

               
,

            

               
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions

                  

               
, 

            

               
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

            

               
Whereas:

            

               
(1)
Member States have been affected by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in an unprecedented manner. It affects migration, security and border management in Member States, which in turn aggravates the serious liquidity shortages Member States are facing due to the sudden and important increase in public investments needed in many sectors. This has created an exceptional situation which should be addressed with specific measures.

            

               
(2)
It is necessary to provide additional flexibility to Member States to enable them to respond to this unprecedented crisis by enhancing the possibility to make full use of the available implementation period up until the closure of programmes by 31 December 2023. In order to respond to this need, the deadlines for decommitment and submission of requests 
for payment of the annual balance
 should be aligned. The regulatory deadline 
for requests for payment of the annual balance is 15 February, whereas the initially foreseen decommitment deadline was 31 December of the preceding year. By aligning both deadlines to 15 February, the request for payment of the annual balance submitted by the Member State on 15 February will be taken into consideration for the purpose of the decommitment exercise.
 

            

               
(3)
In order to ensure that Member States can make full use of additional allocations granted in 2018 and 2019, the year of the budget commitment should be adjusted
. Those additional allocations 
were included in the European Union’s general budget for the financial years 2018 and 2019

                  

               
 and subsequently committed to the national programmes as referred to in Article 14 of the Regulation (EU) No 514/2014.  

            

               
(4)
In order to provide Member States with legal certainty about the decommitment deadline this Regulation should enter into 
force on the day following that of its publication in the 
Official Journal of the European Union
.

            

               
(5)
Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly,

            

               
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

In respect of amounts corresponding to the additional allocations assigned to the national programmes in the year 2019, the year of the budget commitment shall be 2020. ” 

            

               
Article 2
