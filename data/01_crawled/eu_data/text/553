Text proposed by the European Commission
CoR amendment
At Union level, the European Semester of economic policy coordination (‘European Semester’), 

                           
including

                        
 the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, is the framework to identify national reform priorities and monitor their implementation. Member States develop their own national multiannual investment strategies in support of those reforms. Those strategies should be presented alongside the yearly National Reform Programmes as a way to outline and coordinate priority investment projects to be supported by national and/or Union funding.
At Union level, the European Semester of economic policy coordination (‘European Semester’), 

                           
incorporating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and

                        
 the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights, is the framework to identify national 

                           
and regional

                        
 reform priorities and monitor their implementation

                           
, by means of clear national and regional indicators

                        
. Member States

                           
, in cooperation with local and regional authorities within their spheres of competence and taking account of the specific features of the different regions they represent,

                        
 develop their own national multiannual investment strategies in support of those reforms. Those strategies
, 
developed in partnership with regional and local authorities on the basis of a code of conduct setting out guidelines on good governance for the programming of recovery plans and projects,

                        
 should be presented alongside the yearly National Reform Programmes as a way to outline and coordinate priority investment projects to be supported by national and/or Union funding. 

                           
There is also a need for these strategies to use EU funding in a more consistent manner and to maximise the added value of the financial support provided, notably from the European Structural and Investment Funds, the Recovery Fund and the InvestEU Programme.

                        

                     

            

               
Reason

            

         
The content of this paragraph should be brought into line with that of the proposed regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement on the InvestEU Programme, in particular as regards recognition of the role of local and regional authorities in the European Semester and consistency in the use of EU funds and instruments. It should also be pointed out that the Semester must incorporate the SDGs.

Reason

            

         
Since the legal basis for the proposal for a regulation is Article 175(third paragraph) TFEU, it is imperative that cohesion be clearly recognised in its objectives.

COM(2020) 408 final — Recital 5
Text proposed by the European Commission
CoR amendment

                        

                           
The implementation of reforms helping national economies to achieve a high degree of resilience, building adjustment capacity and unlocking growth potential are among the EU’s policy priorities. They are therefore crucial to set the recovery on a sustainable path and support the process of upward economic and social convergence. This is even more necessary in the aftermath of the pandemic crisis to pave the way for a swift recovery.

Past experiences have shown that investment is often drastically cut during crises.

 will also help make the Union more resilient and less dependent by diversifying key supply chains.
Past experiences have shown that investment

                           
, including the majority share of public investments made by local and regional authorities,

                        
 is often drastically cut during crises

                           
, which exacerbates the detrimental effect on economic development and on economic, social and territorial cohesion

                        
.

Reason

            

         
Local and regional authorities are responsible for more than half of public investment in the EU and are particularly affected by investment cuts in times of crisis. It also seems important to highlight the detrimental consequences of this under-investment.

CoR amendment

                        

                           
Currently, no instrument foresees direct financial support linked to the achievement of results and to implementation of reforms and public investments of the Member States in response to challenges identified in the European Semester, and with a view to having a lasting impact on the productivity and resilience of the economy of the Member States.

                        

                     
 

            

               
Reason

            

         
This statement may be open to debate, particularly in view of the role played by European Structural and Investment Funds in addressing the problems identified by the European Semester.

            
Amendment 6

         
COM(2020) 408 final — Recital 8
Text proposed by the European Commission
CoR amendment
Against this background, it is necessary to strengthen the current framework for the provision of support to Member States and provide direct financial support to Member States through an innovative tool. To that end, a Recovery and Resilience 

                           
Facility

                        
 (

                           
the ‘Facility’

                        
) should be established under this Regulation to provide effective financial 

                           
and significant

                        
 support to step up the implementation of reforms and related public investments in the Member States. 

                           
The Facility should be comprehensive and should also benefit from the experience gained by the Commission and the Member States from the use of the other instruments and programmes.

                        

                     
Against this background, it is necessary to strengthen the current framework for the provision of support to Member States and provide direct financial support to Member States 

                           
and to local and regional authorities

                        
 through an innovative tool. To that end, a Recovery and Resilience 

                           
Fund

                        
 (

                           
the ‘Fund’

                        
) should be established under this Regulation to provide effective 

                           
and sufficient

                        
 financial support to step up the implementation of reforms and related public investments in the Member States 

                           
and in local and regional authorities, particularly in view of reaching the objectives of the new sustainable growth strategy presented in the European Green Deal, as well as to ensure that Member States and Local and Regional Authorities have the necessary capacity for a coordinated response by funding the establishment for regional or local monitoring.

                        

                     

            

               
Reason

            

         
The term ‘Facility’ sounds too technocratic and is insufficiently grounded in local and regional reality. Moreover, local and regional authorities account for more than half of public investment in the EU. They are also key actors for cohesion, for achieving the SDGs, and for the green and digital transitions. They must be able to benefit fully from this mechanism. The potentially ‘global’ nature of the ‘Facility’ still needs to be clarified.

In order to enable measures to be taken that link the Facility to sound economic governance, with a view to ensuring uniform implementing conditions, the power should be conferred on the Council to suspend, on a proposal from the Commission and by means of implementing acts, the period of time for the adoption of decisions on proposals for recovery and resilience plans and to suspend payments under this Facility, in the event of significant non-compliance in relation to the relevant cases related to the economic governance process laid down in the Regulation (EU) No XXX/XX of the European Parliament and of the Council [CPR] (…). The power to lift those suspensions by means of implementing acts, on a proposal from the Commission, should also be conferred on the Council in relation to the same relevant cases.

Amendment 12

         
COM(2020) 408 final — Recital 21
Text proposed by the European Commission
CoR amendment
In order to ensure the national ownership and a focus on relevant reforms and investments, Member States wishing to receive support should submit to the Commission a recovery 

                           
and resilience

                        
 plan that is duly reasoned and substantiated. The recovery 

                           
and resilience

                        
 plan should set out the detailed set of measures for its implementation, including targets and milestones, and the expected impact of the recovery 

                           
and resilience

                        
 plan on growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience; it should also include measures that are relevant for the green and the digital transitions; it should also include an explanation of the consistency of the proposed recovery 

                           
and resilience

                        
 plan with the relevant country-specific challenges and priorities identified in the context of the European Semester. Close cooperation between the Commission 

                           
and

                        
 the Member States should be sought and achieved throughout the process.
In order to ensure the national ownership and a focus on relevant reforms and investments, Member States wishing to receive support should submit to the Commission a recovery plan that is duly reasoned and substantiated. 

                           
In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and partnership, the recovery plan should be established in close and structured cooperation with local and regional authorities, insofar as the reforms and investments to be supported fall within their sphere of competence as established in national law.

                        
 The recovery plan should set out the detailed set of measures for its implementation, including targets and milestones, and the expected impact of the recovery plan on 

                           
economic, social and territorial cohesion,

                        
 growth potential, job creation and economic and social resilience; it should also include measures that are relevant for the green and the digital transitions; it should also include an explanation of the consistency of the proposed recovery plan with the relevant country-specific challenges and priorities identified in the context of the European Semester. Close cooperation between the Commission, the Member States

                           
, the European Committee of the Regions and local and regional authorities

                        
 should be sought and achieved throughout the process.

            

               
Reason

            

         
Local and regional authorities hold key political competences and financial responsibilities for achieving the objectives of the Fund (cohesion, sustainable development, etc.) and it is therefore crucial that recovery plans be drawn up in close and structured cooperation with these authorities. This concerns not only the legitimacy and fairness of the instrument but also its effectiveness. The instrument’s legal basis also requires the plans to contain a report on the impact on cohesion of the measures to be financed.

appropriately

                        
 reflected in the National Reform Programmes, which should be used as a tool for reporting on progress towards completion of recovery

Reason

            

         
Quarterly reports may appear to be an excessive bureaucratic burden.

COM(2020) 408 final, Article 1
Text proposed by the European Commission
CoR amendment
This Regulation establishes a Recovery 

                           
and Resilience Facility

                        
 (

                           
the ‘Facility’

This Regulation establishes a Recovery 

                           
Fund

the ‘Fund’

                        
). […]

            

               
Reason

            

         
In line with the amendment to Recital 8, the term ‘Facility’ sounds too technocratic and may be misleading, given the fact that the fund is based on grants and loans.

Those resources shall be used for the benefit of the Member State concerned.

                        

                     
 

            

               
Reason

            

         
The option of transferring resources to the Recovery and Resilience Fund from the Structural and Investment Funds entails the risk of recentralising and undermining the management of the Structural and Investment Funds, which operate on the partnership principle.

Measures linking the Facility to the protection of the Union’s budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law

                        

                     

                           

                              
1.

                           
   

                              
In the event of generalised deficiency as regards the rule of law in a Member State affecting the principles of sound financial management or the protection of the financial interests of the Union, as defined in Article 3 of Regulation […/…] on the protection of the Union’s budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States, the Commission shall, adopt a decision by means of an implemented act to suspend the time period for the adoption of the decisions referred to in Articles 17(1) and 17(2) or to suspend payments under the Recovery and Resilience Facility.

                           

                        

                           

                              
The decision to suspend payments referred to in paragraph 1 shall apply to payment applications submitted after the date of the decision to suspend.

                           

                        

                           

                              
The suspension of the time period referred to in Article 17 shall apply from the day after the adoption of the decision referred to in paragraph 1. In case of suspension of payments, Article 4(3) of Regulation […/…] on the protection of the Union’s budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States shall apply.

                           

                        

                           

                              
2.

                           
   

                              
In the event of a positive assessment by the Commission in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation […/…] on the protection of the Union’s budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States, the Commission shall, adopt a decision by means of an implementing act to lift the suspension of the time period or of payments referred to in the previous paragraph.

                           

                        

                           

                              
The relevant procedures or payments shall resume the day after the lifting of the suspension.

                           

                        

                           

                              
3.

                           
   

                              
Where the Member State in question makes inadequate use of the allocated funding or in case of deficiency with regards to rule of law, regional and local level actions that contribute to addressing those challenges shall continue to benefit from the Facility.

Maximum financial contribution
Maximum financial contribution
A maximum financial contribution shall be calculated for each Member State for the allocation of the amount referred to in Article 5(1)(a), using the methodology set out in Annex I, based on the population, the 

                           
inverse of

                        
 the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the 

                           
relative

                        
 unemployment rate of each Member State.
A maximum financial contribution shall be calculated for each Member State for the allocation 

                           
during the period up until 31 December 2022

                        
 of the amount referred to in Article 5(1)(a), using the methodology set out in Annex I, based on the population 

                           
and

                        
 the 

                           
detrimental impact that the health crisis has had on

Allocation of financial contribution
1.   For a period until 31 December 2022, the Commission shall make available for allocation EUR 

                              
334 950 000 000 

                           
, referred to in point (a) of Article 5(1). Each Member State may submit requests up to their maximum financial contribution, referred to in Article 10, to implement their recovery 

                              
and resilience

                           
 plans.
1.   For a period until 31 December 2022, the Commission shall make available for allocation EUR 

                              
252 000 000 000 

                           
, referred to in point (a) of Article 5(1). Each Member State may submit requests up to their maximum financial contribution, referred to in Article 10, to implement their recovery plans.
2.   For a period starting after 31 December 2022 until 31 December 2024, 

                              
where financial resources are available, the Commission may organise calls in line with the calendar of the European Semester. To that effect, it shall publish an indicative calendar of the calls to be organised in that period, and shall indicate, at each call, the amount available for allocation. Each Member State may propose to receive up to a maximum amount corresponding to its allocation share of the available amount for allocation, as referred to in Annex I, to implement the recovery and resilience plan.

                           

                        
2.   For a period starting after 31 December 2022 until 31 December 2024, 

                              
a revision of the methodology set out in Annex I shall be proposed by the Commission by 15 June 2022, in order to agree on the distribution of the EUR 108 000 000 000  still available and to take account of the territorial, economic and social impact of the pandemic during the period 2020-2021 on the basis of consolidated statistical data

                           
.

            

               
Reason

            

         
The allocation of any resources still available should be based not on a ‘call for tender’ but on factual statistical data during the period 2020-2021.

COM(2020) 408 final — Article 14(1)
Text proposed by the European Commission
CoR amendment
In pursuance of the objectives set out in Article 4, Member States shall prepare national recovery and resilience plans. These plans shall set out the reform and investment agenda of the Member State concerned for the subsequent four years. Recovery and resilience plans eligible for financing under this instrument shall comprise measures for the implementation of reforms and public investment projects through a coherent package.
In pursuance of the objectives set out in Article 4, Member States shall prepare national recovery and resilience plans. These plans shall set out the reform and investment agenda of the Member State concerned for the subsequent four years. Recovery and resilience plans eligible for financing under this instrument shall comprise measures for the implementation of reforms and public investment projects through a coherent package. 

                           
For the preparation of the recovery and resilience plans, Member States can make use of the Technical Support Instrument in accordance with Regulation XX/YYYY [establishing Technical Support Instrument]. Measures starting from 1 February 2020 related to the economic and social consequences caused by the COVID-19 pandemic onwards shall be eligible. Reflecting the European Green Deal as Europe’s sustainable growth strategy and the translation of the Union’s commitments to implement the Paris Agreement and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, at least 40 % of the amount of each Recovery and Resilience Plan shall contribute to mainstreaming climate and biodiversity actions and environmental sustainability objectives. By means of a delegated act, the Commission shall adopt the relevant methodology to help the Member States to fulfil that requirement.

                        

                     

                        

                           
Reflecting the future-oriented character of the Next Generation EU recovery instrument and acknowledging the importance of the Digital Skills Agenda, the Child Guarantee and the Youth Guarantee for preventing the young people of today from becoming a ‘lockdown generation’, each recovery and resilience plan shall contribute to tackling the risk of long-lasting damage to young people’s labour market prospects and to their overall well-being through comprehensive employment, education and skills solutions and responses targeting young people.

The recovery 

                           
and resilience

                        
 plan presented by the Member State concerned 

                           
shall constitute an annex to its National Reform Programme and

                        
 shall be officially submitted at the latest by 30 April. 

                           
A draft plan may be submitted by Member State starting from 15 October of the preceding year, together with the draft budget of the subsequent year.

                        

                     
The recovery plan presented by the Member State concerned shall be officially submitted at the latest by 30 April.

            

               
Reason

            

         
The deadlines set under the European Semester hardly lend themselves to a process of ‘annexing’ recovery plans, let alone providing ‘pre-notification’ more than six months in advance. The competent authorities must be allowed greater flexibility and adaptability for presenting their plans.

When drawing up their proposals for recovery plans, and insofar as the reforms and investments to be supported fall within the sphere of local and regional authorities’ competence as defined by the national legal framework, Member States shall establish a mechanism for structured cooperation with local and regional authorities aimed at ensuring their full participation in the preparation of plans and showing due regard for the principle of subsidiarity. Member States shall reflect this in their recovery plans.

The Commission shall establish a recovery and resilience scoreboard (the ‘Scoreboard’) displaying the status of implementation of the agreed reforms and investments through the recovery and resilience plans of each Member State.

The Scoreboard shall include key indicators, such as social, economic and environmental indicators, that evaluate the progress registered by the recovery and resilience plans in each of the priority policy areas that define the scope of this Regulation as well as a summary of the monitoring process regarding the compliance with the minimum shares of expenditure on climate and other environmental objectives.

The Scoreboard shall indicate the degree of fulfilment of the relevant milestones of the recovery and resilience plans and the identified shortcomings in their implementation, as well as the recommendations of the Commission to address the respective shortcomings.

CoR amendment
At Union level, the European Semester of economic policy coordination is the framework to identify national reform priorities and monitor their implementation. Member States develop their own national multiannual investment strategies in support of those reform priorities. Those strategies are presented alongside the yearly National Reform Programmes as a way to outline and coordinate priorities to be supported by national and/or Union funding. They should also serve to use Union funding in a coherent manner and to maximise the added value of the financial support to be received notably from the programmes supported by the Union under the structural and cohesion funds, and from other programmes.
At Union level, the European Semester of economic policy coordination 

                           
(the ‘European Semester’), including the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights and incorporating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),

                        
 is the framework to identify national reform priorities and monitor their implementation. Member States

                           
, in cooperation with local and regional authorities within their spheres of competence,

Reason

            

         
The content of this paragraph should be brought into line with that included in the proposal for a regulation and the Interinstitutional Agreement concerning the InvestEU programme, and with the proposal concerning the ‘Recovery and Resilience Facility’, including the recognition of the role of local and regional authorities in the European Semester. It should also be noted that the Semester must incorporate the Sustainable Development Goals.

The general objective of the technical support instrument should be to promote the Union’s economic, social and territorial cohesion by supporting Member States efforts to implement reforms necessary to achieve economic and social recovery, resilience and convergence. To that effect, it should support the strengthening of the administrative capacity of the Member States to implement Union law, in relation to challenges faced by institutions, governance, public administration, and economic and social sectors.

Reason

            

         
Consistency should be ensured with Articles 2 and 4 of the proposed regulation, which state that the instrument is intended to support all public authorities in the Member States, including local and regional authorities, which are responsible for the implementation of a significant proportion of Union law, as well as for more than half of public investment and one third of public expenditure as a whole.

II.   
POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

         
THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS,

            
With regard to what is referred to as the ‘Recovery and Resilience Facility’,

         
1.
welcomes the fact that the budget size of this new instrument, namely EUR 360 billion in grants and EUR 312,5 billion in loans to be committed by the end of 2024, provides a macroeconomic response commensurate with the scale of the 2020 recession, the worst ever to have been experienced in the history of the European Union, with a fall of 8,3 % in GDP 
1
. The CoR also supports the balance the proposal strikes between grants and loans. The risk of further widening of socioeconomic divergences justifies the rapid adoption and implementation of the ‘Recovery Plan for Europe’ and the post-2020 EU budget as of autumn 2020;
2.
emphasising that the legal basis of the proposal (Article 175 TFEU) relates to the objective of cohesion, the CoR is concerned at the weak territorial dimension of the Commission’s proposal, given that the social and economic repercussions of the coronavirus crisis are unevenly distributed between Member States and, within them, between regions: firstly, because the health and human impact has been highly regionalised and healthcare capacities are unevenly distributed; secondly, because coronavirus prevention measures have also varied in duration and severity depending on the regional health situation; and thirdly, because some economic sectors are disproportionately affected with the socioeconomic impact at local and regional level therefore depending on the most important industries, the type of jobs available and exposure to global value chains in each region. Without specific mitigation measures, the coronavirus crisis is therefore likely to create or reinforce regional disparities within and between Member States. Cohesion and solidarity must be placed at the forefront of our investment priorities;
3.
cautions that the European Semester as a governance mechanism for the Fund (referred to as ‘Facility’) remains a centralised and top-down exercise that is not appropriate for a tool that is supposed to strengthen economic, social and regional cohesion; therefore reiterates its proposal for a code of conduct to involve local and regional authorities (LRAs) in the European Semester 
2
. This code is more urgent and necessary than ever if the Semester is to become more transparent, inclusive and democratic, and also more effective, by involving regional and local authorities;
4.
recognises that the specific Next Generation EU recovery measures represent an opportunity for all regions, especially those hardest hit by the economic crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, to promote the modernisation of their economic models and to make them more productive and resilient. Regrets, however, that the proposed allocation key for the first tranche of 70 % of commitments, in the form of transfers from the Recovery Fund, is based on socioeconomic indicators that refer to the situation prior to the health crisis, and does not take into account the impact of the pandemic on these indicators, since the economic effects of the crisis have, from the outset, been distributed unevenly across the regions;
5.
points out that the economic downturn is occurring at a time when many key industry sectors are already facing major challenges as a result of the digital and environmental transformation. To manage the change, the EU must not fall behind in global competition in innovation. This demands substantial investment in research and development and in skills acquisition and upgrading; the Recovery and Resilience Facility should also be used to make such investment possible;
6.
insists, therefore, that LRAs should be involved in drawing up plans for recovery through structured cooperation with the Member States, insofar as the reforms and investments to be supported fall within the sphere of local and regional authorities’ competence, and in accordance with the national legal framework for the division of powers between tiers of government. The Committee encourages the Commission, in consultation with the CoR, to already present guidelines to this end in autumn 2020. For its part, it undertakes to organise a biannual assessment of the implementation in the regions of the recovery plans;
7.
considers, furthermore, that the deadlines set within the European Semester hardly lend themselves to a process of ‘annexing’ the recovery plans to the National Reform Programmes, let alone providing ‘pre-notification’ more than six months in advance. The competent authorities must be allowed greater flexibility and adaptability for presenting their plans;
8.
notes that on 17 September 2020, the Commission presented the parallel publication of the Guidance to Member States on Recovery and Resilience Plans 
3
 and the Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy (ASGS). In this context, points out that:
—
it currently seems that the Commission is proposing to merge the national recovery and resilience plans and national reform programmes and that it no longer plans to propose country-specific recommendations,
—
while the Commission asks the Member States to ‘describe the institutional nature of the plan, as well as the role of their national/regional parliaments, other regional/local authorities, and national advisory bodies such as national fiscal boards and national productivity boards in the decision process leading up to the adoption/submission of the Recovery and Resilience Plans’, it does not set any requirements as to the involvement of local and regional authorities in preparing them,
—
the territorial dimension does not seem to be a programming priority in these documents,
—
the Commission is presenting seven flagship initiatives 
4
 which the recovery and resilience plans are expected to fit into. These flagship initiatives may be seen as additional constraints on the strategic planning of the recovery and resilience plans. Furthermore, none of these seven flagship initiatives relates to social cohesion, despite the fact that it has been undermined by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Proposes organising a ‘Recovery and Resilience Forum’ jointly with the European Commission, in order to boost local and regional authorities’ participation in the recovery plan and to assess their contribution to cohesion and to the green and digital transitions;
9.
points out, lastly, that LRAs are responsible for more than half of public investment in the EU — much of it in key sectors such as health, education, social services, housing, transport and tourism– and that it would therefore be absurd for them not to be able to benefit from this support for public investment. Support of this kind is particularly necessary in times of crisis, with the last decade having illustrated the harmful pro-cyclical consequences of cuts in public investment, which is all too often used as an adjustment variable in the face of budgetary constraints;
10.
stresses the role that the proposed instrument must play for the climate, but considers that the recovery plans should be earmarked for at least 40 % of spending on climate action to enable the European Union to meet its climate commitments. The CoR also believes that the Commission’s proposal should incorporate all the Sustainable Development Goals as a strategic planning framework;
11.
opposes the option of transferring resources to the recovery and resilience instrument from the Structural and Investment Funds (Article 6), as such an option entails the risk of recentralising and undermining the management of the Structural and Investment Funds, which operates on the partnership principle;
12.
sees the application of macroeconomic conditionality as a useful measure that would help to ensure targeted use of EU funds in the Member States;
13.
reiterates its call for a clear definition of the reforms eligible for support from the ‘Recovery Fund’ and/or the Technical Support Instrument, showing due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, by stating that they should respond to the following criteria and be:
(i)
relevant for the implementation of the objectives of the Treaty on European Union;
(ii)
relevant to convergence and the reduction of regional disparities in the spirit of the legal basis of Article 175 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU);
(iii)
able to trigger investment and stimulate long-term sustainable growth, consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals;
14.
stresses that before the recovery and resilience ‘fund’ can be rolled out, local and regional authorities implementing projects need a stable legal framework for state aid at European and national level. In particular, they need to know whether the European framework for state aid will be set up on an ad hoc basis to take account of the increased volume of aid and obtain guarantees on the responsibilities and deadlines for notifying aid;
15.
stresses that the term ‘Facility’ appears too technocratic, is incomprehensible to mere mortals and is ambiguous in a number of official EU languages, thus creating an obstacle to decentralised communication on the subject of the EU’s responses to recovery and resilience; suggests, therefore, that the term ‘Facility’ be replaced by ‘Fund’;

            
With regard to the Technical Support Instrument
,
16.
welcomes the Commission’s presentation of the proposal for a regulation establishing a Technical Support Instrument, which is likely to contribute to strengthening the administrative capacity of public authorities and thus to better implementation of reforms and more effective public management;
17.
strongly supports the fact that the instrument is intended not only for national administrations but also for LRAs, as stated in Article 2 of the proposal;
18.
considers, however, that the proposal for a regulation needs to be clarified and made more consistent, in particular as regards Article 8 on requests for technical support, which must come from a national authority within the meaning of Article 2 and not exclusively from a Member State.
