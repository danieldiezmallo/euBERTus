This staff working document (SWD) accompanies the fourth biennial report “Implementing EU food and nutrition security policy commitments”.

            

               
The fourth report highlights the progress which the EU and its Member States (MS) have achieved towards implementing their common policy framework to assist developing countries in addressing food security challenges

                  

               
. Since its adoption in 2010, the policy framework has guided the EU and its Member States in engaging in international cooperation and development assistance concerning food security. A specific Implementation Plan was adopted in 2013, further detailing commitments in this area. Subsequently, the EU and its Member States have reported every second year on progress made on the 2010 policy framework and the 2013 implementation plan. A first biennial report was issued in 2014, a second in 2016, and a third in 2018. In line with Article 210(2) Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the fourth report is coordinated by the European Commission, with inputs from the following MS: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom

                  

               
. The financial reporting of the report and this accompanying SWD covers up to and including 2018 (for methodological/comparability reasons), while experiences captured also include 2019.

Highlights on the progress made in policy priorities

            

               
This section presents highlights of the progress made in the six policy priorities and reflects how the EU and its Member States have stepped up support to increasingly address them in an integrated manner. 

            

               
“Improve smallholders’ resilience and livelihoods” 
remains the most significant part of the EU and its Member States’ development cooperation portfolio. This support is increasingly addressing the underlying dynamics of the socio-economic, environmental, and security factors of sustainable, resilient and healthy food systems. The development of such food systems should strenghen sustainable rural development.

            

               
“Enhancing the resilience of the most vulnerable to food crises”
 also remains significant in the development cooperation of the EU and its 
Member States
. 
The EU continues to support the Global Report on Food Crises which 2020 edition showed that, for the third consecutive year, over 100 million people suffer from acute hunger and malnutrition.

                  

               
 In order to address the immediate needs and the underlying dynamics of the socio-economic, environmental, and security trends generating food crises, the EU is supporting the transformation of food systems to prevent food crises, mitigate their impact and boost recovery.

            

               
The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) plays a critical role in agri-food transformation with a focus on three priorities addressed across the humanitarian-development-peace nexus: the Network generates consensus-based information on food crises

                  

               
; leverage strategic investments to prepare, prevent and respond to food crises; and foster political uptake and coordination across sectors. During a High Level Event held in April 2019 
Food & Agriculture in times of crisis: working better together for long-term solutions
, the EU, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Italy, and Finland and their partners reiterated their support to the GNAFC action at national, regional, and global level.

            

               
The EU, France, and Germany reiterated their support to the Committee on World Food Security. The EU and its Member States have significantly increased
 responsible investments in agriculture and agri-businesses
. Blending assistance has increased markedly in 2018 with
 the AGRIFI Facility set up with the Dutch Development Bank (FMO); a contribution to the African Agriculture Trade and Investment Fund (AATIF) via Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau
 (
KfW); the Agri-Business Capital (ABC) Fund managed by IFAD and established with the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the international NGO AGRA; and the HURUMA Fund focussing on micro-loans with the Spanish agency for international cooperation and a Spanish development finance institution (COFIDES). 
The EU continues to support land governance interventions in about 40 countries and the development of value chains with a particular focus on their economic, social and environmental impact. The EU contributes to the development of fisheries and aquaculture value chains to boost economic returns and social equity, and reduce negative impacts on the marine environment. The FISH4ACP innovative programme develops sustainable fisheries and aquaculture in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific paying special attention to small-scale fisheries because of their potential to deliver economic and social benefits, particularly for women.

            

               
The EU and its Member States cooperate in the Development-Smart Innovation through Research in Agriculture (DeSIRA) Initiative. Within this framework, the EU stepped up its support to the overall governance and architecture for agricultural research and innovation (e.g. funding the Tropical Agricultural Platform (TAP), Global Forum on Agricultural Research (GFAR), the CAADP research and extension organisations and the CGIAR). DESIRA has also enhanced country research capacities for innovation within national agriculture knowledge and innovation systems with projects addressing agro-ecology and climate-relevant practices; agroforestry; livestock; or the water–energy–food–forest nexus. A number of interventions are specifically implemented in partnership with EU Member States including Italy (Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Niger and Sudan), the Netherlands (Mali, Benin, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Kenya), and France (Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar, and ECOWAS), which also provided financial support.

            

               
To support the implementation of 
social protection programmes
 in situations of shocks and protracted crises, the EU produced a Guidance Package including guiding principles, lessons learned and promising practices. EU support to social protection mechanisms remained significant in 2018: EUR 237 million. In Yemen the 
EU
, 
Germany
, 
UK
, and 
the Netherlands
 significantly support the Social Fund for Development interventions enhancing livelihoods and empowering smallholders. During the emergency period 2016–18, the Fund directly benefited more than 62,000 thousand people (47% women). 
In Niger, the EU and its 
Member States 
continue to support the capacity of 
The Dispositif National de Prévention et de Gestion des Crises Alimentaires, 
progressively integrating social protection schemes to tackle chronic malnutrition and support production and capital reconstitution.

            

               
The 
EU
, 
France
, 
Germany
, 
Ireland
,
 the Netherlands, 
and the
 United Kingdom
 support the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement. The fourth progress report on the implementation of the Commission’s Action Plan on Nutrition published in 2019 highlights the need to further escalate nutrition-relevant actions at country level, by mobilising the full potential of sectoral interventions necessary to address the range of causal factors of malnutrition in orderto achieve the global stunting reduction target by 2025. The 2020 resource-tracking exercise confirmed that by 2019, the Commission’s EUR 3.5 billion global pledge for nutrition has already been achieved – one year ahead of schedule. Moreover, the EU is increasing its efforts to analyse how its support is contributing towards changes in stunting. The EU remains committed to strengthen global governance and accountability mechanisms (SUN networks and the 2019 and 2020 Global Nutrition Reports) and support the implementation of country partners’ policies and action plans for nutrition through a 
Capacity for Nutrition 
programme implemented in partnership with Germany. 

            

               
The EU partners have increasingly embarked on nutrition JP: in 
Lao PDR
 the 
EU, France, UK, Ireland, Germany, 
and Switzerland support the Government’s National Nutrition Strategy and Plan of Action. The Mid-Term Review of this programming highlighted the good progress made in terms of division of labour, policy dialogue, and strengthening the Provincial Nutrition Committees with a priority given to the provinces with the worst nutrition indicators. The Review also suggested further efforts to be made to use more effectively the local coordination mechanisms, mainstream nutrition programming across sectors, and expand joint implementation. 

            

               
Through the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF for Africa) in 
Burkina Faso,
 the 
EU
 was able to support nearly 950,000 beneficiaries by improving access to basic social services (health, nutrition, water and sanitation); strengthening livelihoods (small-scale agriculture and livestock, income generating activities, cash transfers); and improving the capacity of actors at the local level. It sets out a good example of partnering effectively with decentralised government services and civil society to improve local governance accountability and civil society participation. In a context where local authorities are affected by lack of resources to effectively implement decentralisation, positive experiences were demonstrated in terms of better and more responsible water management, public works and resource management. Improving the relationship of trust between local authorities and citizens has made it possible to improve the payment of local taxes (in seven communes, these increased by 20%), making it possible to initiate other local actions. 

            

               
In 
Myanmar
, the 
Livelihoods and Food Security Fund
 (LIFT) multi-donor initiative funded by the 
EU
, the 
UK
,
 
Australia, Switzerland, the USA, Canada
 
and
 Ireland
 contributed to improve nutrition, income diversification and skills development. The programme supports innovative maternal and child cash transfers (incorporating social and behaviour change communication interventions). These inputs showed significant positive results thereby reinforcing the government’s policy and budgetary commitments. Endorsed in November 2018 a Multi-sectoral National Plan of Action on Nutrition (MS-NPAN) engages key actors and stakeholders to develop sub-national planning with convergence across interventions and services. A transformative approach to enhanced gender equality is also central to LIFT’s strategy, whether via interventions fostering equitable access to and control over land and natural resources or support to vocational training and livelihood opportunities for youth in camps established for internally displaced people (IDPs). In 2018, LIFT had reached 11.6 million people and 2.6 million families while 247 out of 330 townships have benefited from the programme’s support.

CASE STUDIES

            

               
2.1
EU Joint Programming (JP) in Bolivia

            

               
In May 2018, the then European Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, Neven Mimica, and Bolivia’s Ministers of Planning and of Foreign Affairs launched the 2017-2020 Joint European Strategy (JES) for Bolivia

                  

               
 with an indicative funding of EUR 530 million. One of the largest recipients of EU bilateral development assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean, Bolivia has been among the first countries to embark on JP with a JES adopted by the Government,
 
the 
EU, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Sweden, 
the 
United Kingdom 
and Switzerland
.
 The development of the Strategy has built on a roadmap, a joint analysis and a Common European Strategy in place since 2014. The partners used the flexibility allowed in the process to build trust and ownership. They also invited Switzerland to join the process. The JES is aligned with Bolivia’s 2025 Patriotic Agenda and the 2016-2020 Economic and Social Development Plan, which in turn, are aligned with both the SDGs and COP21 objectives. 

            

               
The Strategy has not led to a reduction of the number of donors per sectors or the number of sectors covered per donor: it encompasses eight priority sectors and 5 crosscutting approaches. In the food security and rural development sector, the EU and its Member States (
Germany, Denmark, and Italy
) fund a programme package worth EUR 66 million to support the 2016-2020 Plan for the Agricultural and Rural Sector with Integral Development

                  

               
. 
The EU
 supports the fight against illicit drugs by promoting alternative economic and employment opportunities to coca growers with a Sector Reform Contract worth EUR 27 million, while the 
Danish
 cooperation strengthens the institutional capacities of the Ministry of Rural Development and Land (EUR 20 million). Having a limited number of Member States willing to embark on sectoral JP proved to be an enabling factor in a context where collaboration with the government is good and European visibility was (and still is) high. Moreover, those Member States that were in the process of phasing out (
Belgium and Sweden
) took advantage of the JES exercise to further ensure the sustainability of their programmes with the on-going interventions. 

            

               
JP has created greater awareness around the programmes/projects managed by the EU+ group and in several sectors such as environment and climate change, it has fostered collaboration and coordination. In the food security and rural development sector maintaining the momentum to keep the JP process going proved to be challenging and further efforts should contribute to move from joint strategising to joint implementation. Maintaining regular dialogue and joint activities are key incentives to bring Member States together via a more sustained coordination approach and more guidance regarding joint implementation opportunities and joint reporting expectations. The next programming exercise offers a good opportunity for the EU+ partners for the alignment of bilateral strategies and their linkages to the SDGs and the Paris Agreement objectives. As the European Consensus on Development (2017) makes results frameworks core elements of the joint response to inform policy dialogue and enhance mutual accountability, the next JES should use SDGs indicators as key JP performance indicators (if measurable at country level) and an emphasis should be put on the availability of means of verification - at sector level - when selecting key indicators.

            

               
2.2
EU JP in Madagascar

            

               
In 2017, the 
European Union
 and the most active EU Member States in the country (
Germany and France
) embarked on a joint JP process organised around the SDG themes of People, Planet, Prosperity, and Peace. A joint analysis was validated in July 2018 which included three key avenues for cooperation: (i) support to good governance and effective institutions; (ii) the sustainable use of natural resources; and (iii) support to the emerging industrialisation, in particular through the quality and adequacy of education including labour skills. Following the presidential elections -marking the first political alternation of power in the country- the Malagasy Government prepared the 2019-2023 
Plan Emergence Madagascar
 (PEM) which should provide the strategic framework for the next steps of JP planned in 2020. 

            

               
The main challenge in this process relates to the alignment of the EU partners to the government policy framework and more specifically the delayed adoption of the PEM. From a sectoral perspective, the transition has enabled the establishment of a structured policy dialogue that takes place within the framework of coordination platforms and includes the government and the development partners. The EU partners implement rather similar interventions spread across the country, including the support to food and cash crops along value chains, institutional capacity building, the improvement of nutrition, and the sustainable management of natural resources alongside adaptation to climate change. In these areas, a range of joint initiatives translates a culture of collaboration and partnership. 

            

               
France and Germany
 have been actively involved in the Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture sector for an extended period, and with the 
EU Delegation
, have increasingly jointly implemented programmes and projects across sectors. The wide array of collaborative efforts by the EU partners has improved the synchronisation and complementarity of their interventions – including in terms of support to the civil society. This ‘working better together’ culture has clearly eased the development of JP. JP is facilitated by the presence of a limited number of Member States, geographical complementarity, good communication flows between the EU partners; and since 2019, the establishment of a Dialogue and Cooperation Group boosting multi-sectoral coordination. 

            

               
The challenge now is to consolidate the progress made in a context where there is limited ownership of the national development plan. The EU partners are adopting a pragmatic approach and move a sectoral JP exercise forward around the fight against environmental degradation and climate change, taking into account that agriculture and livestock activities are the most important factors causing deforestation and land degradation in Madagascar. In order to achieve a greater impact, the JP is expected to promote a more integrated, coordinated, and focused approach based on an increased division of labour. The EU partners could seize this opportunity to incorporate the objectives of Agenda 2030, the Paris Agreement and the EU Green Deal into this second phase of the JP and enhance policy dialogue, alongside data collection and analysis. In this manner bilateral strategies can be progressively replaced by a joint EU programme.

FURTHER DETAILS ON THE THEMATIC FOCUS

            

               
3.1
Gender

            

               
The 2
nd
 EU Gender Action Plan (GAPII) underlines the link between gender inequalities and disparities and food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture, and supports transformative change for equal access to land and assets, and control over resources. Reflecting this commitment to a gender transformative approach, the EU interventions incuding gender-responsive activities in FNS have risen from 37% in 2014 to 57% in 2018. EU interventions increase women’s access to productive resources and employment opportunities, stimulate behaviour changes such as strengthened joint decision-making in rural households, and provide women with platforms to voice their rights. 

            

               
In 
Malawi
, the EU strengthens land governance systems for smallholder farmers by training local officials on women’s land rights and developing a Women’s Land Rights Forum whose members have enhanced women’s leadership skills. In 
Lao PDR
, the EU funds the “Sustainable Change Achieved through Linking Nutrition and Governance” programme supporting video clips on national television that examine the role of men during women’s pregnancy and in childcare activities. 

            

               
In 
Kenya, Mozambique, Malawi and Senegal
, the LANDac programme funded by the 
Netherlands
 supports successful initiatives promoting and extending women’s access to agricultural land. The programme focuses on women’s voice and vision, actively involving them in data collection and increasing their role in land governance related discussions. 

            

               
Italy
 has been engaged in gender equality and women empowerment, strenghtening women access to value chains in 
Mozambique
, scaling up Community-based Maternal and Child Nutrition Services in 
Afghanistan,
 or enhancing the skills and networking capacity of shepherds and farmers in 
West Bank
 vulnerable communities 

            

               
The EU developed thematic briefs underlining the principles of social change and gender transformation in policy dialogue and programming. The briefs detail how to incorporate a gender-responsive approach in land governance, nutrition, and value chains development. The brief
 “Closing the gender gap through agri-food value chain development”
 complements for example the EU’s Value Chain Analysis for Development (VCA4D) methodology, which provides a detailed assessment of a value chains’ operation and its impact on the social dimensions of sustainable development – gender equality being one of the six domains of the social analysis. In 
Cambodia
 the VCA4D tool highlighted women participation in aquaculture activities in the semi-intensive and small-cage production systems and their under-representation in decision-making processes in the fisheries policy.

            

               
Together with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP), and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the EU will support the activities of the three agencies to embed gender transformative approaches in policy dialogue, programmes, institutional culture and the working modalities of the Rome-Based Agencies (RBAs), while contributing to deliver on SDG2. The aim is to contribute to the achievement of food security and nutrition and sustainable agricultural development by addressing the root causes of gender inequalities principally in – but not limited to – rural areas and triggering transformative change processes that lead to the empowerment of women in their households, communities, and society for the improved well-being of all persons.

            

               
The EU has also stepped up its engagement in advocating a transformative gender approach in its policy dialogue. The EU, jointly with 
Germany and Finland 
organised for example a side event on women’s land rights and women’s empowerment at the Commission on the Status of Women held in New York in 2018. With the partner countries, the EU has contributed to the drafting of national strategies emphasising gender equality in 
Nepal
 and in 
Kenya
, joint gender analysis with EU Member States as a step to forge partnerships across sectors in 
Madagascar
, or stepped up the coordination between EU partners in delivering gender-sensitive messaging on violence against women in 
Colombia
. 

            

               
Funded by the EU Trust Fund and the 
Netherlands and Austrian
 Development Cooperation (EUR 48.3 million), the Resilience Building Programme in Ethiopia (RESET II) builds people and community’s resilience in the most vulnerable areas of the country. The programme has contributed to successfully mainstream gender in its strategy, approach and tools. Half of the 1.9 million people reached by the programme were women whose vulnerability has been reduced and capacity strengthened. In the Wolaita cluster, the EU focused on extremely poor women (with 0.125 ha and some labour), members of women’s economic groups. By increasing their skills, connecting them to formal systems such as savings and loans groups, and providing livestock and drought-resistant/nutritious seeds/roots free of charge, the programme contributed to shift women’s status from dependency to self-reliance.

            

               
3.2
Rural employment creation

            

               
In September 2018, the Commission published a Communication on a new Africa – Europe Alliance for Sustainable Investment and Jobs

                  

               
,
 
aiming to enhance job creation and sustainable and inclusive development. In this context, Jobs and Growth Compacts (JGC) are being developed, steering joint efforts around value chains with the highest potential for job creation. In July 2019, the EUD 
Uganda
 prepared a strategic JGC serving the programming exercise and as a means to foster convergence towards the EU key priorities identified with EU Member States, financial institutions and other actors as well as through structured dialogue with the government and the private sector. In June 2019, under the French Presidency, the G7 adopted a Framework on decent job creation for rural youth in the Sahel. Developed by the G7 Working Group of Food Security, this Framework was jointly welcomed by the G7 and G5-Sahel ministers and by the G7 Summit, as part of the Biarritz Sahel Partnership Action Plan. Acknowledging that the creation of decent jobs for rural youth in the Sahel should help meet the twin challenges of food insecurity and poverty while providing new economic opportunities for young Sahelians.

            

               
In the framework of the Alliance, the EU supports a range of actions to boost investment and job creation, including through the AgriFI initiative that provides blended finance to increase investment in smallholder agriculture and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The EU supports the development of agricultural value chains taking advantage of the opportunities offered by local, regional and global markets. This is based on the assessment of the economic, social and environmental aspects of value chains in development, using the VCA4D Facility. In partnership with Agrinatura

                  

               
, the EU applied this tool in value chain programmes to identify if and how growth generated by those value chains’ activities impact job creation. This has, for instance, been the case in 
Zambia
 (egg and aquaculture), 
Honduras
 (coffee), 
Sierra Leone
 (palm oil), 
Tanzania 
(coffee), 
Guinea Bissau
 (mango and lime), 
Burundi
 (banana), and 
Benin
 (pineapple).

                  

               
 

            

               
France, Italy and Germany
 promoted agricultural entrepreneurship for young people in agricultural value chains to increase income and employment prospects in a wide range of countries. For example in 
Sierra Leone
, 
Germany
 supports the “Employment Promotion Programme (EPP III)” boosting job creation in cocoa, coffee, rice and vegetables value chains. The programme works with MSMEs and youth to improve skills – with strong mentorship and coaching elements as a means of increasing self- and wage employment. Between 2016 and 2019, the EPP III supported 1,200 businesses and trained 36,000 youth, creating more than 9,000 new jobs and self-employment opportunities. By 2019, the programme positively affected more than 250,000 people. In Somalia, 
Italy
 is promoting innovative agricultural technologies for economic growth.

            

               
The 
EU 
significantly contributed to job creation through the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF). In the 
Sahel and Lake Chad
 region more than 27,500 jobs were created, 129,000 people developed income-generating activities and more than 50,000 people benefited from professional training and or/skills development between 2018 and 2019. With the aim to increase the economic participation among young people -thereby contributing to the EUTF’s stabilisation efforts in the region- approximately 700,000 youths have been supported by the EUTF through job creation initiatives, support to find a work placement, skills development, and/or professional training.
 
For example, in Cameroon high-intensity labour programmes contributed to create 6,200 jobs, while in Senegal, the programme 
‘Développer l’emploi au Sénégal’
 supported existing or new MSMEs and provided professional training and/or skills development to 18,700 people.

METHODOLOGICAL NOTE
 

            

               
This section briefly outlines data sources, definitions and classifications used to produce the figures presented in this report.

            

               
Purpose

            

               
The fourth EU report provides a consolidated assessment of EU and 
Member States’ 
achievements on the six food and nutrition security policy priorities set out in the Implementation Plan. It provides information on how their collective performance delivered on these policy priorities, and on the level of coherence, complementarity and coordination, based on a quantitative assessment of total food and nutrition security interventions, as well as a qualitative assessment of how well the EU and its 
Member States 
are working together at national, regional and global levels.

            

               
Data

            

               
In this report, data is limited to EU 
institutions
 and ten 
Member States
: 
Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and United Kingdom

                  

               
. The total ODA flows of these donors 
amounted
 to 91.2% of the total ODA flows of the EU Institutions and twenty-eight member states in 2018. The OECD/DAC reported disbursements data is used as a source. FNS disbursements flows in this report concern only development initiatives and disbursements recorded under DAC humanitarian sector codes are not included.

            

               
Core contributions at multilateral level to a range of UN agencies, funds and programmes
 
were not taken into account, when it was difficult to allocate a proportion of this funding to food and nutrition security. Only those contributions to these agencies that specifically target food and nutrition security as stated below (points A, B and C) are considered.

In order to ensure the greatest possible consistency, a common approach is applied by the EU and its 
Member States
. Programmes/projects meeting the following conditions are supposed to contribute to food and nutrition security:

            

               
A.
which have a particular focus on FNS (by being specifically designed to improve FNS, or by having specific FNS objectives or activities), and/or 

            

               
B.
which cearly fall within one or more of the four pillars of food security – food availability, access to food, utilisation of food and stability, and/or 

            

               
C.
which clearly fall within the definition of ‘FNS’: “Food and nutrition security exists when all people at all times have physical, social and economic access to food, which is consumed in sufficient quantity and quality to meet their dietary needs and food preferences, and is supported by an environment of adequate sanitation, health services and care, allowing for a healthy and active life.”

            

               
Number of food and nutrition security programmes

            

               
The diversity of implementation modalities across the EU institutions and EU 
Member States 
makes it difficult to use a standard definition of “programme”. The lack of comparable data for it, resulted in taking the number of disbursements recorded in the OECD DAC CRS database as a proxy for the number of programmes. Although, this overestimates the number of programmes in absolute terms in a given time, it is a reliable method to observe an evolution over time, which is the main purpose of the report. In addition, the data for 2018 cover all disbursement amounts in the database, which were limited to disbursements above EUR 100,000 in the previous reports.

            

               
Classification of the identified 
food and nutrition security interventions

            

               
a)
Gender and climate sensitiveness and research

            

               
OECD DAC CRS policy markers are referenced to identify whether a project targets gender equality and environmental objectives. Research related disbursements have been captured by specific DAC sector codes (agricultural research, fishery research etc ), as well as by some implementation partners with a research mission (e.g. 
CGIAR Fund and member organisations and other)
.

            

               
b)
Geographical classification

            

               
The geographical classification is made in two ways. First, by geographical area of recipients adjusted to this exercise but closely aligned to OECD DAC classification. Neighbourhood region includes the EU Neighbourhood policy partner countries and a few other European countries. Another classification refers to the policy intervention level: whether a project is designed with impacts at country, regional or global level. At country level, the OECD DAC list of ODA recipients and country names conventions is used.

            

               
c)
Policy priority classification

            

               
FNS disbursements are regrouped in the six sub-groups according to one of the six FNS policy priorities set out in the Implementation Plan.

            

               
A project is classified only under one priority. Due to financial breakdown difficulties and to avoid double-counting, for multi-sectorial projects, only one priority, i.e. the one which seems the most important, is assigned and allocated the full project budget amount.

            

               
The description of the six policy priorities is provided below, with some examples of typical activities.

2. Support policies and programmes in partner countries which aim to increase access for smallholder farmers, in particular women farmers, to land and water resources, improved farm inputs, credit, and extension services, and which aim to reduce post-harvest losses and improve storage facilities.

               

                  
3. Assist partner countries in addressing climate change and its effects on food and nutrition insecurity and agricultural development through adaptation, mitigation and resilience-building measures.

               

                  
4. Support pro-poor, demand-led research for development and technology transfer, extension and innovation, and ensure that this research is accessible to, and used by, smallholder farmers and in particular, women.

               

                  
5. Support programmes in rural areas which aim to build resilience and generate income and off-farm employment, including by assisting smallholder and women farmers, to add value to their produce and to develop viable agribusinesses, to improve the links between smallholder farmers and markets and to enhance the efficiency of agricultural value chains.

3. Support initiatives to strengthen and enhance the functioning of civil society organisations in partner countries and farmers’ organisations, particularly those which actively target poor smallholder and women farmers as members, contributing to their empowerment to participate in decision-making and implementation and evaluation of programmes.

               

                  
4. Support programmes which focus on empowering women, strengthening their decision-making role at household level, including in relation to decisions about food production, consumption and the use of household assets, and which seek to ensure that women’s voices are heard and integrated into decision making at national and local levels.

               

                  
5. Increase support to continental, regional and national CAADP programmes and plans.

Interventions

               

                  
1. Support the development and implementation of regional level agricultural policies and strategies to step up integration of regional food markets and disease control programmes, including food safety against foodborne illness.

               

                  
2. Reinforce regional information systems in support of agriculture and food and nutrition security policies, including those for early warning systems and transparency in markets.

               

               
Policy priority 4: 
Strengthen social protection mechanisms for food and nutrition security, particularly for vulnerable population groups

            

                  
Interventions

               

                  
1. Support countries to develop nationally owned and led comprehensive social protection systems which are flexible, adapted to local contexts, and target both labour and non-labour constrained vulnerable population groups, and funded increasingly from domestic resources.

               

                  
2. Support existing social protection programmes to expand their coverage and linkages with other sectors and enhance predictability, reliability, sustainability, scalability, resilience and the crisis response capacity of the interventions.

               

               
Policy priority 5: 
Enhance nutrition, in particular for mothers, infants and children

            

                  
Interventions

               

                  
1. Increase advocacy with partner country governments to raise the profile of nutrition within their respective national strategies and programmes, and to align their resources accordingly.

               

                  
2. Increase financial and technical support to partner countries to scale up and effectively address under-nutrition and improve national governance on nutrition, with a particular focus on those countries which have signed up to the SUN Movement.

               

                  
3. Increase financial support for scaling up proven direct nutrition interventions, in particular those which combat maternal, infant and child under-nutrition and the irreversible effects of chronic under-nutrition in early childhood, targeting the 1,000 day window of opportunity from pregnancy to the age of 2.
