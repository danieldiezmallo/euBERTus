THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund 
1
 and in particular Articles 18(3), 72(3), 97(2) and 107(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Regulation (EU) 2020/560 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
2
 has amended Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 to introduce specific measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector.
(2)
In order to allow the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2020/560, the model for operational programmes under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (‘the EMFF’) and the structure of the compensation plans for operators in the outermost regions set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 771/2014 
3
 should be adjusted, taking into consideration the requirements of the new measures.
(3)
The implementation of Regulation (EU) 2020/560 also requires adjustments to the technical specifications and rules for the presentation of cumulative data on operation and information to be sent by Member States set out in Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 1242/2014 
4
 and (EU) No 1243/2014 
5
. These adjustments should allow a reliable monitoring and reporting of operations related to the mitigation of the COVID-19 outbreak. Pursuant to Article 97(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, the annual deadline for providing the cumulative data on operations is 31 March. This means that Member States should submit this information in the amended format as of 2021, so as to ensure consistent and harmonised reporting.
(4)
Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 771/2014, (EU) No 1242/2014 and (EU) No 1243/2014 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5)
In order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation due to the urgency in providing the requisite support, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication.
(6)
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund,
