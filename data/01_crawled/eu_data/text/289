(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive (EU) 2016/798 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on railway safety 
1
, and in particular Article 10(10) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Directive (EU) 2016/798 was amended by Directive (EU) 2020/700 
2
 in order to give Member States the possibility to extend the deadline to bring into force the national laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the provisions referred to in Article 33(1) of Directive (EU) 2016/798.
(2)
The assessment of applications for a safety certificate in accordance with Directive 2004/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
3
, for which the safety certificate had to be issued before 16 June 2020, might be delayed because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, in the Member States that have notified the Agency and the Commission in accordance with Article 33(2) of Directive (EU) 2016/798 and where Directive (EU) 2016/798 is to apply from 16 June 2020, the national safety authority (‘NSA’) should, at the request of the applicant, continue the assessment beyond that date. The NSA should finalise that assessment and issue the safety certificate before 30 October 2020.
(3)
With regard to Member States that have notified the European Union Agency for Railways (‘the Agency’) and the Commission in accordance with Article 33(2a) of Directive (EU) 2016/798, the application of certain provisions of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/763 
4
 should be postponed and apply from 31 October 2020. Transitional provisions set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/763 should also be adapted.
(4)
Applicants may have compiled applications in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/763 in view to the current application deadline. Applications drawn up in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/763 should include all the necessary evidence for the safety certification of railway undertakings under either Directive 2004/49/EC or Directive (EU) 2016/798. Therefore, applicants should be allowed to submit, to national safety authorities in Member States that have notified the Agency and the Commission in accordance with Article 33(2a) of Directive (EU) 2016/798, applications which list evidence in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/763. National safety authorities should accept those applications without requiring a revised application.
(5)
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/763 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(6)
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 28(1) of Directive (EU) 2016/798.
(7)
In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the
