Introduction

            

               
The purpose of Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 2 for the year 2020 is to provide EUR 3 000,0 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 1 530,0 million in payment appropriations under heading 3 
Security and Citizenship
 to finance the provision of emergency support within the Union through the Emergency Support Instrument, which is proposed to be re-activated to help tackle the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak and to further reinforce the Union Civil Protection Mechanism/rescEU to allow wider stock-piling and coordination of essential resource distribution across Europe

Providing emergency support to Member States through the re-activation of the Emergency Support Instrument within the Union

            

               
2.1. 

                  
   
Context

            

               
Given the depth of the crisis following the COVID-19 outbreak as well as the extent and nature of the needs requiring support from the EU budget in the immediate future, the Commission proposes in parallel to this DAB that the Council reactivates and amends Council Regulation 2016/369 on the provision of emergency support within the Union

                  

               
 to 
equip the EU with a broader toolbox commensurate to the large scale of the current COVID-19 pandemic
.

            

               
The Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) was created in March 2016 and was activated for a period of 3 years to address the
 emergency situation which had arisen following the massive influx of refugees in Greece. It was designed as a general purpose tool to fight crises within the EU and intervenes only in exceptional circumstances of severe difficulties. 
It can be mobilised to address
 any crisis requiring humanitarian aid 
and covers a broad scope of eligible actions: “
Emergency support … may include any of the humanitarian aid actions and may consequently encompass assistance, relief and, where necessary, protection operations to save and preserve life in disasters or in their immediate aftermath
”

                  

               
. 

            

               
The measures foreseen under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (rescEU), the Civil Protection Mechanism, the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative to deploy European Structural and Investment Funds and other Union instruments are contributing to partly address the public health emergency; however, the scale and scope of the challenge requires to address effectively the public health related humanitarian consequences of the outbreak within the Union. Emergency support provided under the ESI
 promotes complementarity to and consistency with actions of the affected Member States, as well as synergies with actions financed at EU level under other funds and instruments. 

            

               
In view of the above, support under the Emergency Support Regulation (No 2016/369) is proposed to be activated and provided with the necessary appropriations as soon as possible. This will allow the Union to deploy measures preventing and mitigating severe consequences in one or more Member States and to address in a coordinated manner the needs related to the COVID-19 disaster, by complementing any assistance provided under other EU instruments.

            

               
2.2.

                  
   
Actions to be financed through the ESI

            

               
Given the urgency of the situation and the serious nature of the COVID-19 outbreak related public health crisis in all Member States, the Commission proposes to provide 
EUR 2 700,0 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 1 380,0 million in payment appropriations
 to the ESI. 

            

               
Support may be used to finance inter alia the following actions:

            

               
–
wider and faster stock-piling and coordination of essential resource distribution across Europe;

            

               
–
meeting the transport needs for protective gear to be imported from international partners as well as transport across the EU;

            

               
–
transportation of patients in need to cross-border hospitals which can offer free capacity;

            

               
–
cross-border cooperation to alleviate the pressure on health systems in the most affected EU regions; 

            

               
–
central procurement and distribution of essential medical supplies to hospitals
 and 
emergency supply of protective gear for hospital staff, such as respirators, ventilators, personal protective equipment, reusable masks, medicines, therapeutics and laboratory supplies and disinfectants;

            

               
–
increasing and converting production capacities of EU enterprises to ensure rapid production and deployment of equipment and material needed to urgently address supplies shortages of essential products and medicines;

            

               
–
increasing care facilities and resources, including temporary and semi-permanent field hospitals and support for reconverted facilities;

            

               
–
increasing the production of testing kits and support for acquiring key basic substances; 

            

               
–
boosting the swift development of medication and testing methods;

            

               
–
developing, purchasing and distributing testing supplies (testing kits, reagents, hardware).

            

               
The Commission will ensure full coordination so that actions financed under the ESI complement  other existing instruments such as rescEU or the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) in certain areas (for instance in reception facilities for migrants). The deployment will be adapted to the development of the outbreak and coordinated with measures undertaken by Member States to maximise impact.

Further reinforcement of the 
Union Civil Protection Mechanism (within the Union)

            

               
As part of the EU’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak, UCPM facilitates cooperation between Member States. In addition to the joint procurement and as a further safety net, the Commission has adopted a new Implementing Act under UPCM/rescEU in order to 
support Member States in purchasing some of the needed equipment
 (including therapeutics, medical equipment, Personal Protective Equipment, laboratory supplies), thus increasing the volume, complimenting and widening the scope of priority items purchased through the joint procurement. The rescEU direct grant will provide 100 % financing from the EU budget, which includes full financing for development of the these capacities and full financing of deployment. The equipment purchased will be hosted by one or more Member States, while decision-making is organised at EU level, providing emergency supplies over and beyond the national stocks. It will be available to all Member States and will be used in case of insufficient national capacity. 

            

               
As announced with the Draft Amending Budget No 1/2020

                  

               
, the Commission redeployed EUR 10,0 million in commitment appropriations to support COVID-19 medical countermeasures and equipment from within the existing UCPM/rescEU budget for 2020 (prevention and preparedness within the Union) and proposed a reinforcement of EUR 70,0 million in commitment and EUR 40,0 million in payment appropriations.

            

               
In view of the rapid development of the crisis and the associated needs in the Member States, the scale of our stock-piling efforts needs to be further reinforced. rescEU can contribute to wider stock-piling, coordination and distribution of essential medical supplies in high demand to hospitals, including protective gear for hospital staff (masks, goggles, overalls, nano-materials for medical use, disinfectants), ventilators (both invasive and non-invasive ventilators) needed for an effective response. Stocks are to be used to dispatch at short notice necessary medical equipment successively to those MS and regions experiencing outbreaks and epidemic peaks in infections, making an efficient and effective use of reusable equipment where it is most needed.

            

               
A further reinforcement of EUR 300,0 million in commitment and EUR 150,0 million in payment appropriations are therefore proposed. 

            

               
The reinforced rescEU and the re-activated ESI will be complementary and will ensure the most efficient provision of the needed medical equipment.

Financing

            

               
Given the absence of margins and room for redeployment under heading 3 of the multiannual financial framework (MFF), the Commission proposes to mobilise the following special instruments for the total amount of EUR 3 000,0 million:

            

               
·
The remaining Global Margin for Commitments for an amount of EUR 2 042,4 million

                  

               
. 
An amendment of the MFF Regulation removing the limitations in the scope of this instrument is proposed in parallel to this Amending budget

                  

               
;
