COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS
EU strategy for a more effective fight against child sexual abuse

               

            

               
INTRODUCTION

            

               
The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights recognises that ch
ildren have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their well-
being, among other provisions. T
he 1989 
UN
 Convention on the Rights of the Child 
establishes the right of the child to be protected from all forms of violence

                  

               
.

            

               
Child sexual abuse is a particularly 
serious
 crime that 
has
 
wide-ranging and serious 
life-long consequences
 
for
 
victims
. 
In hurting 
children, these crimes also cause 
significant 
and long term 
social harm
. 
In many cases, children are sexually abused by persons they know and trust, and on whom they are dependent

                  

               
. 
This makes 
these crimes 
particularly
 
difficult to prevent and detect. 
The
re are indications that the
 
COVID
-
19
 crisis has 
exacerbated the problem

                  

               
,
 especially for 
children 
who 
live with their abusers

                  

               
.
 
In addition, c
hildren are 
spending more time 
than before 
online, possibly unsupervised
. While this 
has 
allow
ed
 them to continue their education
al studies
 and stay in touch with their peers, there are signs of increased risk
 
of 
children com
ing
 into contact with 
online predators

                  

               
. 
W
ith more 
offenders 
isolated at home, the 
demand for child sexual abuse material
 has increased (e.g. by 25% in some Member States

                  

               
), which in turn leads to increased demand for new material, and therefore 
new abuses

                  

               
. 

            

               
The Council of Europe estimates that in Europe, 
one in five children fall victim
 to some form of sexual violence

                  

               
.
 
Sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children can take multiple forms and 
they
 can occur 
both
 
online
 (e.g. forcing a child to engage in sexual activities
 via live streaming or
 exchanging child sexual abuse material online) 
and offline
 (e.g. engaging in 
sexual activities with a child or causing a child to participate in child prostitution)

                  

               
. 
When the abuse is also recorded and shared online, the harm is 
perpetuated
. 
V
ictims have 
to live with the knowledge that images and videos of the 
crime
s
 
showing 
the worst moments of their lives
 are being circulated and anyone, including 
their 
friends or relatives, may see them.
 

            

               
The exponential development of the digital world has 
been abused 
making
 this crime a 
truly global one
, and has unfortunately 
facilitated
 the creation of a 
global
 market for child sexual abuse 
material
. 
The past few years have seen a 
dramatic increase
 in 
reports of 
child sexual abuse 
online 
concerning
 
the EU
 (e.g. images exchanged in the EU
, victims in the EU, etc
.
)
: from 23
 
000 in 2010 to 
more than 
7
25
 
000 in 2019
, which included more than 3 million images and videos

                  

               
.
 A similarly dramatic increase has occurred globally: from 1 million 
reports
 in 2010 to 
almost 
1
7
 million in 2019, which included nearly 70 million images and videos

                  

               
.
 
R
eports
 indicate that the 
EU 
has become the 
largest host of child sexual abuse material globally
 (
from more than half in 2016 to 
more than two thirds
 in 2019
)

                  

               
.
 

            

               
Recently, an investigation into child sexual abuse in Germany resulted in the discovery of potentially more than 30 000 suspects using group chats and messenger services to share materials, incite each other to create new materials, and exchange tips and tricks on how to groom victims and hide their actions

                  

               
. The use of 
end-to-end encryption
 
makes identifying perpetrators more difficult if not impossible. In this particular example, to date, only 72 suspects in Germany have been identified and 44 victims.

            

               
The introduction of 
end-to-end encryption
, while beneficial in ensuring privacy and security of communications, also facilitates the access to secure channels for perpetrators where they can hide their actions from law enforcement, such as trading images and videos. The use of encryption technology for criminal purposes therefore needs to be 
immediately addressed
 through possible solutions which could allow companies to 
detect and report
 child sexual abuse in end-to-end encrypted electronic communications. Any solution would need to ensure both the privacy of electronic communications and the protection of children from sexual abuse and sexual exploitation, as well as the protection of the privacy of the children depicted in the child sexual abuse material. 

            

               
The fight against child sexual abuse 
is
 
a priority for the EU
. 
The
 European Parliament

                  

               
 and the
 
Council

                  

               
 
have 
both 
call
ed
 for 
further 
concrete action. Similar calls have been made globally in multiple forums

                  

               
, including by the media

                  

               
, as 
it has become evident that 
the world as a whole is 
losing the battle 
against these crimes
, and is failing to effectively protect the right of each child to live free 
from 
violence
.
 The E
U therefore needs to 
reassess
 and 
strengthen its efforts
.
 

            

               
The aim of this strategy is to provide an effective response, at EU level, to the fight against child sexual abuse.
 
It
 
provides 
a 
framework 
for 
develop
ing
 a strong and 
comprehensive
 
response
 
to these crimes
, both in their 
online 
and 
offline
 form
.
 It 
sets out 
eight
 
initiatives
 to 
implement and develop the right legal framework, strengthen 
the 
law enforcement response and 
catalyse 
a coordinated 
multi-stakeholder action 
in 
relation to
 
prevention, 
investigation
 and 
assistance to victims
.
 
The 
initiatives 
make use of all 
tools available
 at EU level, both 
as regards 
substantive EU law
 
(section 
I
)
 and 
as regards 
funding and 
cooperation
 (
section 
II
)

                  

               
.
 
This strategy is
 
to be implemented over the next five years (2020-2025)

                  

               
.

            

               
I. IMPLEMENT AND DEVELOP THE RIGHT LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO PROTECT CHILDREN

            

               
In 2011, t
he EU took an important step with the adoption of the Child Sexual Abuse 
Directive 
(
2011/93/EU

                  

               
), whose 
implementation
 in Member States now has to be finalised as a matter of 
urgency
. In parallel, 
any identified 
legislative gaps need to be addressed
 through the most appropriate means.

            

               
1.
Ensure 
complete
 
implem
entation of 
current
 legislation
 (Directive 2011/93
/EU
)

            

               
The Child Sexual Abuse Directive was the first 
comprehensive EU legal instrument
 establishing minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child sexual abuse material, covering the prevention, investigation and prosecution of offences, and assistance to and protection of victims. 

            

               
The criminal offences cover 
offline and online
 situations such as viewing and distributing child sexual abuse material online, grooming (i.e. establish an emotional connection with the child online with the purpose of sexual abuse) and webcam sexual abuse. Beyond substantive and procedural criminal law, the Directive also requires Member States to put in place extensive administrative (i.e. non-legislative) measures, such as on the exchange of criminal records between Member States via the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) as part of the pre-recruitment screening for positions involving direct and regular contacts with children, or training of professionals likely to come into contact with child victims of sexual abuse. These measures require the involvement and coordination of 
multiple actors
 from various areas of government (e.g. law enforcement, healthcare, education, social services, child protection authorities, judiciary and legal professionals), as well as private entities (e.g. industry and civil society).

            

               
Member States have made 
substanti
al
 progress 
in
 
implement
ing
 
the Directive
.
 
However, there is still considerable scope for the Directive to reach its full potential through
 the
 
complete implementation
 of all of its provisions by Member States. 
C
hallenges remain 
in the areas of 
prevention
 (i
n particular prevention programmes for offenders and for people who fear that they might offend), 
criminal law
 
(
especially the
 definition of offences and level of penalties), and 
assistance
, 
s
upport and protection
 measures for 
child
 
victims

                  

               
.
 
In 2019, t
o ensure 
complete 
implementation, 
the Commission 
opened 
infringement procedures
 against 23
 Member States

                  

               
.
  

            

               
The Commission 
will 
continue to 
work closely with Member States to resolve all remaining issues 
as 
a matter of priority
 and ensure 
complete implementation of and 
full compliance with the Directive across the EU. 
The Commission will 
also support Member States 
work in this area 
by continuing to facilitate the 
exchange of best practices
 and lessons learned

                  

               
.
 

            

                  
Key action:

               

                  
ð
Member States must 
finalise the implementation
 of the Child Sexual Abuse Directive 
as a matter of priority
. The Commission will continue to make use of its 
enforcement powers
 under the Treaties through infringement procedures
 as necessary
 to ensure swift implementation. 

               

               
2.
Ensure that EU legislation enables an effective response 

            

               
The Commission will assess whether the 
Child Sexual Abuse Directive
 needs to be updated, taking into account the study referred to in initiative #3 below. In addition to the Child Sexual Abuse Directive, there are multiple 
legislative instruments at EU level
 that support and shape the fight against child sexual abuse, notably when it comes to the role that the private sector plays in preventing and combating child sexual abuse. 

            

               
The 
e-evidence proposals

                  

               
, put forward by the Commission in April 2018, play a key role in facilitating swift access to key evidence held by the private sector, such as the identity of individuals who have uploaded and shared child sexual abuse material. The Commission reiterates its call for 
swift adoption
.

            

               
In addition, the relevant framework includes the 
e
-commerce Directive

                  

               
, which determines the existing liability rules for online intermediaries and allows for the notice and takedown mechanisms for illegal content
 and 
the 
e-privacy 
Directive

                  

               
. 
T
he 
Commission's proposal for a 
Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications

                  

               
, currently being discussed by the 
European Parliament and the Council
, will 
updat
e
 the legal framework 
and replac
e
 the ePrivacy Directive
. 
As 
from December 2020
, the e-privacy Directive
 will have an extended scope as a result of the 
Electronic Communications Code

                  

               
.
 
This w
ould 
prevent
 
certain
 
companies 
(in the absence of national legislative measures adopted in accordance with Article 15(1) of 
the e-privacy Directive
) 
from continuing their own measures on 
voluntary detection
, removal
 and reporting of child sexual abuse online
. The Commission considers that it is essential to take 
immediate action
 to address this. It will therefore propose a narrowly-targeted legislative solution with the sole objective of allowing 
current 
voluntary
 
activities to continue
.
 
This
 
solution would allow 
the time necessary for the adoption of 
a new longer-term legal framework
, w
hile ensuring the respect of fundamental rights, including the rights to privacy and the protection of personal data.

            

               
The Commission has committed to 
make proposals on the legislative framework for digital services
,
 which would have implications for tackling child sexual abuse material online. 
T
he 
Digital Services Act
 
package
,
 
to be proposed
 
by end of 2020

                  

               
,
 w
ill
 
clarify and 
upgrade liability and safety rules for digital 
services. In this context, the Commission will consider the need to
 remove disincentives for voluntary actions to address illegal content, goods or services intermediate
d online
, in particular in what concerns online platform services
. 

            

               
The Commission considers that the fight against child sexual abuse online requires clear 
mandatory obligations
 to detect and report child sexual abuse online to bring more clarity and certainty to the work of both law enforcement and relevant actors in the private sector to tackle online abuse. It will start preparing 
sector-specific legislation
 in order to tackle child sexual abuse online more effectively, in full respect of fundamental rights, including in particular the right to freedom of expression, protection of personal data and privacy.  Mechanisms to ensure accountability and transparency will be key elements of the legislation in which the centre referred to in initiative # 6 could be involved.

            

               
The 
Europol Regulation

                  

               
, which determines the scope of Europols activities, is also of relevance

                  

               
.
 
The Commission has announced in its 2020 work programme 
a legislative proposal to strengthen 
Europol
s
 mandate
 in order to 
improve
 operational police cooperation.
 
Europol 
has 
e
ncounter
ed 
limit
s
 in the support it can provide because of 
the rapidly
 growing challenge of child sexual abuse.
 
In addition, Europols ability
 to support the Member States 
is 
hampered by 
its
 
inability
 to receive personal 
data
 directly from the private sector
, whose infrastructure is abused by perpetrators to host and share child sexual abuse material. The European Commission will 
further assess
 th
ese issues as part
 of the upcoming 
review of the Europol mandate
, planned for adoption in Q4 2020.

            

               
These possible legislative changes will be 
consistent
 with the EUs policy on combating child sexual abuse and should ensure that there is a legislative framework to enable and support relevant stakeholders in 
preventing
, 
detecting, reporting and acting effectively to protect children
 in any instance of child sexual abuse. 

            

                  
Key actions:

               

                  
ð
In a first stage, 
as a matter of priority
, 
t
he Commission will propose
 
the necessary legislati
on 
to ensure that providers 
of electronic communications services 
can 
continue
 their 
current
 
voluntary practices
 to detect in their systems child sexual abuse after December 2020.

               

                  
ð
In a second stage, 
by Q2 2021, 
t
he Commission will propose
 
the necessary legislati
on 
to tackle child sexual abuse 
online 
effectively including by 
requiring
 
relevant 
online services providers 
to 
detect known
 child sexual abuse material and 
requir
e 
them to 
report
 
that material 
to
 public authorities
.

               

               
3.
Identify 
legislative 
gaps, best 
practices and priority actions 

            

               
The 
transposition 
measures that Member States 
have 
communicate
d
 to the Commission 
include measures that 
are
 not 
specifically 
required by the 
Child Sexual Abuse 
Directive but 
which were 
considered as needed
 in
 the fight against child sexual abuse
 by Member States

                  

               
.
 
This suggest
s
 that there 
might
 be 
relevant 
issues that the Directive 
does not 
sufficiently 
address
.
 
The Commission convened an expert workshop in September 2019 to gather more information about those possible legislative gaps and concluded that further work was required to gather 
additional 
evidence.
 

            

               
As 
t
he Directive was adopted 
in 2011
, 
there should also be an assessment of 
its
 implementation
 
in 
practic
e
, in terms of 
effectiveness,
 
efficiency, relevance, coherence and EU added value
, among other criteria
. 
Th
is
 
assessment 
should consider in particular 
the 
online aspects
 of these crimes
, where doubts exist as to whether the present framework is 
fi
t for purpose after 
9
 
years
 
that have seen significant technological changes
 
and the exponential growth of online sharing
.
 
T
echnology
 has made it easier than 
ever before 
for perpetrators to make contact with children, share images of abuse, hide their identity and profits
,
 and 
conspire with
 
each other to 
avoid accountability and 
commit further crimes

                  

               
.

            

               
Furthermore
, offenders have become increasingly sophisticated in their use of technology and technical capabilities including 
encryption
 and 
anonymity
 
(e.g.
 
peer-to-peer file
 sharing and the use of darknet)
. This 
criminal activity 
creates problems for society in general and for law enforcement 
in particular 
in its role of protecting society

                  

               
. 

            

               
In light of the above, the Commission will launch as a matter of priority a 
study to identify legislative and implementation gaps, best practices and priority actions
 at EU level, assessing: 

            

               
·
whether the current 
EU 
legislation solv
es
 the 
issues for which it was put in place
; and

            

               
·
whether there are 
new issues
 
in relation to
 
these crimes that the current legislation address
es
 
only partially or not at all.
 

            

               
The study will take into account the ongoing work by the 
Council of the EU
 
to 
ensur
e
 the effective implementation of its October 2019 conclusions on combatting child sexual abuse, which 
could lead to the 
creation 
or update of national action plans to coordinate action at national level. 
It 
will also take into account the November 2019 
European Parliament
 resolution

                  

               
, the December 2017 European Parliaments r
eport on the transposition of the Child Sexual Abuse Directive

                  

               
,
 
and
 the work of the Council of Europes Lanzarote Committee

                  

               
.

            

                  
Key action:

               

                  
ð
The Commission will launch
 by the end of 2020
 an extensive study 
to identify legislative gaps, best practices and priority actions
 at EU level in the fight against child sexual abuse 
online and offline
. 

               

               
II. STRENGTHEN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE AND ENHANCE COOPERATION AMONG ALL STAKEHOLDERS 

            

               
The fight against child sexual abuse needs to be fought on many fronts, including by society at large. Real progress can only be made when work is stepped up in relation to prevention, reporting, referral, investigation, protection and identification, treatment and follow-up of each and every case. Social services, health-care professionals, academics, researchers, educators, the judiciary, law enforcement, children, families, NGOs, media and broader society each have a role to play, in a true multi-stakeholder, multi-disciplinary approach. 

            

               
4.
Strengthen 
law enforcement 
efforts at 
national and EU 
level 

            

               
Child sexual abuse requires a 
competent and comprehensive
 law enforcement response, both at national and at European level.
 T
he 
COVID-19
 crisis has 
brought to light 
the need to improve
 the 
digital capabilities
 of law enforcement 
and judicial 
authorities 
to 
preserve their ability to protect citizens effectively
, as the May 2020 Recovery Plan highlighted

                  

               
.
 

            

               
Law enforcement agencies in Member States vary in structure when it comes to addressing child sexual abuse. To ensure the protection of children within and beyond their borders, it is important that Member States can rely on 
specialised units that are properly equipped and staffed with well-trained officers 
in national policing structures. In response to a recent wave of large-scale cases, a number of Member States have chosen to increase their staff working on preventing and combating child sexual abuse, which the Commission warmly welcomes.

            

               
As part of these units, Member States should consider setting up national 
victim identification
 teams. Where these teams already exist, Member States should consider extending the national level capacity to the relevant regional and local teams. 

            

               
To fight these crimes effectively, Member States should also be able to participate in 
collaborative EU and international efforts to identify children
 with Europols European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) or through the International Child Sexual Exploitation (ICSE) database hosted at Interpol. The resources each Member State assigns to counter the threat of child sexual abuse should also take into account the country's capacity to support international collaboration in this area.

            

               
Child sexual abuse cases, especially those involving digital materials, are rarely limited to one Member State. In addition to maintaining national intelligence databases, Member States should therefore invest in
 
systematically
 
channel
ling
 relevant intelligence to 
Europol
, as a cent
ral 
EU criminal information hub
, to support each other in tackling cross-border cases

                  

               
.
 

            

               
Effectively f
ighting child sex
ual
 abuse 
also 
requires 
cutting edge technical capacities
. Some 
national 
investigation teams lack the necessary
 knowledge and/or
 
tools e.g. 
to 
detect child sexual abuse material in a vast 
number 
of seized photos or videos, to locate victims or offenders
,
 or to conduct investigations in the darknet or in peer to peer networks. To 
support the
 
development of national capacities 
to
 keep up with technological developments
, the Commission 
provides 
fund
ing 
to Member States through the 
Internal Security Fund
 (ISF-Police)

                  

               
. In addition, the Commission also 
provides
 funds under 
ISF-Police
 through Union Actions, which include
, for example, 
call
s
 for proposals and procurement
 to fight the 
online and offline 
aspects of child sexual abuse

                  

               
. A 
new call for proposals
 
i
n the area of 
combatting 
child sexual abuse will take place 
by the end of 
2020.
 
T
he Commission also funds 
research
 projects under 
Horizon 2020
 to support the development of national capacities (in law enforcement and other areas) to fight against child sexual abuse

                  

               
. Future call
s
 for proposals to fight these crimes will open under the new 
Horizon Europe
 
framework programme on research and innovation

                  

               
.
 

            

               
The use of 
online undercover investigation
 techniques is an important asset in infiltrating the networks that are concealed behind this kind of technology. These methods have proven very effective in understanding offender behaviour and interaction on online service providers, and have ultimately facilitated the shutting down of communication channels used by these offenders, as well as their prosecution. An increasingly important need for law enforcement activity in these spaces is the ability to effectively 
infiltrate
 particularly dangerous online groups of offenders. This can be enabled through a number of different methods that are currently only available to a small number of Member States and non-EU partners. Consideration should be given to making this capability available across the EU to more effectively target these offenders without being dependent on other partners. EU values and fundamental rights shall stay in the core of any future measures.

            

               
Europol 
will set
 up an 
Innovation Hub and Lab

                  

               
 to facilitate 
Member State 
access to technical tools and knowledge developed at EU level.
 This initiative will also allow the identification of needs in Member States to tackle the challenges of digital investigations, which will help determine the allocation of EU funding for research, innovation and development of police capacities. 

            

               
The Innovation Hub and Lab will further facilitate Member States access to the resources and experience of 
Europols European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). 
EC3 has played an important role in supporting Member States in combating sexual abuse of children, ever since its creation. This support takes various forms, for example:

            

               
·
EC3 has contributed to 
victim identification
 efforts since 2014.
 
Collaborative actions with the Member States and 
p
artners with 
o
perational 
ag
reements through the Europol Victim Identification Task Forces

                  

               
 and use of 
various investigative approaches including 
the ICSE database have led to the identification of 
almost
 
360 children and 150 offenders
.  

            

               
·
Europol (frequently in cooperation with 
Eurojust
) has helped coordinate numerous 
successful investigations

                  

               
.

            

               
·
Specific
 Operational Action Plans (OAPs) on combating child sexual abuse and exploitation, are implemented 
each year 
under the 
EU Policy Cycle
 / EMPACT for the fight against serious and international organised crime
, supported by Europol

                  

               
.

            

               
·
Europol has been instrumental in the gathering, collation and publication of 
reports
 
such as the
 
Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment
 (
SOCTA
)

                  

               
 and 
Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment
 (
IOCTA
)

                  

               
 
reports, which include specific sections on the fight against child sexual abuse.
 

            

               
·
Europol has also worked with its international partners to provide 
online safety advice for parents and carers

                  

               
 to help keep children safe online during the 
COVID19 crisis, in addition to three weekly intelligence reports for targeted audiences
 

                  

               
.
 

            

                  
Key action:

               

                  
ð
Europol will set up an 
Innovation Hub and Lab 
and the Commission will provide 
funding
 
to 
facilitate
 the development of 
national capacities
 to keep up with technological developments
 and ensure an effective response of law enforcement against these crimes. 

               

               
5.
Enable Member States to better protect children through prevention 

            

               
Some of the articles of the Child Sexual Abuse Directive 
in which 
Member States are 
incurring in more delays to fully implement 
are those 
that 
requir
e putting in place
 
prevention programmes

                  

               
, where multiple types of stakeholders need to take action. 

            

               
As regards prevention targeted at (potential) offenders, Member States difficulties concern programmes at 
all stages
: before a person offends for the first time, in the course of or after criminal proceedings, and inside and outside prison. 

            

               
Research into what motivates individuals to become offenders 
is scarce and fragmented 
and the 
communication between practitioners and researchers is minimal:
 

            

               
·
Th
e current 
lack of research
 
makes it difficult to 
draw up 
and put in place
 effective programmes at all stages.
 T
he few programmes that are in place

                  

               
 
are 
rarely evaluated
 to 
assess 
their effectiveness. 

            

               
·
In addition, the various types of 
practitioners
 
in this field 
(e.g. 
responsible 
authorities providing prevention programmes for people who fear that they might offend, public authorities in charge of prevention programmes in prisons, NGOs offering prevention programmes to support the reintegration in the community of sex offenders) 
do not 
communicate 
sufficiently
 
with each other 
on the effectiveness of the programmes, including 
lessons learned and best practices
. 

            

               
To address these difficulties, the Commission will work on setting up a 
prevention network
 of relevant and reputed 
practitioners and researchers 
to support Member States in putting in place 
usable, rigorously evaluated and effective
 prevention measures to decrease the prevalence of child sexual abuse in the EU and 
facilitate the exchange of best practices
. Specifically, the network would:

            

               
1.
E
nable a 
virtuous cycle
 of 
practice to research and research to practice
: 

            

               
·
R
esearchers 
would 
provide practitioners with 
scientifically tested
 initiatives
, and 
practitioners 
would 
provide researchers with 
continuous feedback
 on the prevention initiatives to further contribute to strengthen the evidence base. 
Victims perspectives
 
and views 
would 
be also brought into the network
s work
.

            

               
·
Although the network work would cover all areas related to preventing child sexual abuse, it would have a strong focus on 
prevention programmes for offenders and for people who fear that they might offend
, as this is the area where Member States struggle the most. 

            

               
·
It is known that 
not all offenders
 
ha
ve
 
a 
paedophilic disorder

                  

               
 
(other motivations 
to offend 
include exploitation for financial gain), and not everyone who has 
a 
paedophilic disorder
 
ends up 
being a
n 
offender
 
(some people seek support in dealing with their paedophilia). Substantial 
research
 is needed to understand 
the process
 by which a person ends up offending, including 
risk factors and triggers.
 
S
ome statistics suggest that up to 85% of those who view child sexual abuse images also physically abuse children

                  

               
.
 
Viewing 
child sexual abuse material
 i
s a
lso
 
a 
criminal offence, which generates demand for new material and therefore new physical abuse

                  

               
. 

            

               
·
The network would follow a 
scientific
 approach
 to prevention. Although prevalence data is scarce, studies indicate that around 
3% 
of the male population could have a paedophilic disorder
.
 Practitioners recognise that 
tackling the problem at its root
 by acknowledging that difficult fact and putting in place preventive measures, is the most effective way to protect victims and alleviate the workload of law enforcement authorities.

It 
would 
facilitate the exchange of information on 
training materials and capacity building
 and collect 



 examples
 to inspire 
media campaigns
 and training across Member States.
 It would help 
avoid duplication
 of efforts by, e.g. facilitating the 
adaptation and 
translation to the national context of materials created in other Member States. 

            

               
·
T
he Commission, supported by the network, 
would 
also launch 
and support 
awareness raising campaigns
 to help inform 
children, 
parents, carers and educators about risks and preventive mechanisms and procedures
. These 
would
 be developed with 
the network.

            

               
·
Prevention efforts
 are necessary in relation to 
organisations that work with children
  sports centres and clubs, religious institutions, healthcare services, schools, afterschool activities  to 
raise awareness
 and to inform them about ways to prevent abuse, e.g. by providing focused 
training

                  

               
, ensuring they have in place appropriate procedures and making use of their legal empowerment under EU law to request criminal records 
across borders 
via the 
European Criminal Records Information System

                  

               
. This highly effective EU system is crucial in the prevention of sexual abuses as it allows to make background checks of an individuals possible criminal history 
when recruiting for professional or 
organised 
voluntary activities involving direct and regular contacts with children
. 
Professionals from all sectors, who might come in contact with children, need to be trained and equipped with the tools to 
prevent and detect 
early signs of possible sexual 
violence
 and abuse, and to interact with children and their families in an appropriate manner, driven by the specific needs and the best interests of the child. This also includes 
law enforcement authorities and the judiciary
 where child victims are involved in criminal investigations against their abusers. Families and carers, professionals and broader society need to understand the seriousness of these crimes and the devastating effect they have on children, and be given the support needed to report these crimes and support child victims. This requires 
specialised information
,
 
media campaigns
 and 
training
.

            

               
·
Children themselves need to have the 
knowledge and tools
 that could help them not to be confronted 
with
 the abuse when possible (e.g. on how to use the web safely), and they need to be informed that certain behaviours are not acceptable. The Commission-funded network of Safer Internet Centres

                  

               
 raise
s
 awareness on online safety and provide
s
 information, resources and assistance via helplines and hotlines on a wide range of digital safety topics including grooming and sexting

                  

               
. The One in Five campaign by the Council of Europe

                  

               
 and Europols 
#SayNo initiative

                  

               
 are further examples of how this can be done. 
When abuse occurs, children need to 
feel 
secure 
and empowered 
to speak up, react and report

                  

               
, even when the abuse comes from within their circle of trust (i.e. loved ones or other people they know and trust)
, as it is often the case
. They also need to have access to safe, accessible and age-appropriate channels to report the abuse without fear. Prevention efforts also need to take into account the 
specific circumstances and needs
 
of various groups of children
 
who are particularly exposed to the risks of sexual abuse, 
such as children with disabilities

                  

               
, children in migration 
(in particular unaccompanied minors) 
and 
children victims of 
traffick
ing (
the majority 
of whom are girls
). 

            

               
The aim is to organise the network in 
working groups
 that will facilitate the exchange of best practices and the work on concrete initiatives to generate tangible output. The working groups could be organised 
by practice
 (i.e. by professional background, e.g. healthcare practitioners, social workers, education practitioners, law enforcement, judicial authorities, prison authorities, policy makers and researchers) and 
by programme
 (i.e. by type of target group of the prevention programme, e.g. offenders and people who fear that they might offend, or training and awareness raising programmes for children, families and the community). 

            

               
Maximising work to prevent child sexual abuse is essential. The exponential increase of child sexual abuse reports 
has overwhelmed law enforcement
 in the EU and globally, reaffirming the consensus among practitioners (including law enforcement) that 
this problem is impossible to solve through law enforcement action only and requires multi-agent coordination.

            

               
The network would aim at 
strengthening the capacity in the EU
 on prevention of child sexual abuse and would have a 
global reach 
to draw on all relevant expertise 
within and outside of the EU
. It would also have an important 
online presence
 to facilitate sharing its work within the EU and globally so that all countries could benefit from state-of-the-art research and approaches.

            

               
In summary, the prevention network would enable: a) more effective 
action
 in the fight against child sexual abuse (
online and offline
) in the EU; b) more effective and efficient 
use of the existing (limited) resources
 in the EU allocated to preventing child sexual abuse; and c) more effective 
cooperation with partners globally
, so that the EU can benefit from global expertise without duplicating efforts. 

            

                  
Key action:

               

                  
ð
The Commission will start 
immediately
 to prepare a prevention network at EU level to facilitate the exchange of best practices and support Member States in putting in place 
usable, rigorously evaluated and effective 
prevention measures to decrease the prevalence of child sexual abuse in the EU.

               

               
6.
A
 European 
centre 
to prevent and counter child sexual abuse 

            

               
The Commission will start working towards the possible creation of a European centre to prevent and counter child sexual abuse, based on a thorough study and impact assessment. The centre would 
provide holistic support to Member States
 in the fight against child sexual abuse, 
online and offline
, ensuring 
coordination
 to maximise the efficient use of resources and 
avoiding duplication
 of efforts. 

            

               
The 
European Parliament
 called for the creation of 
a 
c
entre in its November 2019 
resolution

                  

               
, and 
Member States
 
highlighted 
in their October 2019 Council conclusions 
the need for a 
coordinated and multi
-
stakeholder approach

                  

               
.
 
The 
c
entre 
c
ould build on the best practices and lessons learned 
from 
similar centres around the world
, such as the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the US, the Canadian Centre for Child Protection and the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation. 

            

               
To ensure 
holistic support
 to Member States in the fight against child sexual abuse, and subject to further assessment, the centres functions could cover 
three areas
: 

            

               
1.
Law enforcement
: 
Europol is a key actor in the fight against child sexual abuse, notably through the analysis and channelling of reports of abuse received from the U.S. Building on 
Europols 
role and experience, the 
c
entre
 
c
ould work with law enforcement agencies in the EU and in third countries to ensure that victims are identified and 
assisted 
as soon as possible and that offenders are brought to justice. 
It 
c
ould support Member States by receiving reports
 
in relation to child sexual abuse in the EU
 from companies 
offering their services in the EU
, ensure the relevance
 of such reports
, and forward the
se 
to law enforcement for action. The 
c
entre 
c
ould
 
also 
support companies by, 
for example
, maintaining a 
single database
 in the EU of known child sexual abuse material to facilitate its detection in companies systems
, in compliance with EU data protection rules
. 
In addition, the 
c
entre could also support law enforcement by 
coordinating and 
facilitating the takedown of child sexual abuse material online
 identified through 
hotlines
. 

            

               
The centre could operate according to strict control mechanisms to ensure 
accountability and transparency
. In particular, the centre could potentially play a role in helping ensure that there is no erroneous takedown or abuse of the search tools to report legitimate content (including misuse of the tools for purposes other than the fight against child sexual abuse) and in 
receiving complaints
 from users who feel that their content was mistakenly removed. Accountability and transparency will be
 
key elements of the legislation referred to in the key actions of initiative #2.

            

               
2.
Prevention
: 
building on the work of the prevention network, 
the 
c
entre 
c
ould
 
support Member States in putting in place 
usable, rigorously evaluated and effective
 
multi-disciplinary 
prevention measures to decrease the prevalence of child sexual abuse in the EU
, 
taking account of 
differ
ing
 vulnerabilities of children according to their age,
 gender,
 development and specific circumstances
. It 
c
ould
 facilitate 
coordination
 to support the most efficient use of resources invested 
and expertise available 
on prevention across the EU, 
avoiding duplication
 of efforts.
 
A 
hub for connecting, developing and disseminating research and expertise
, it 
c
ould
 
facilitate and encourage
 
dialogue among all relevant stakeholders and help develop 
state-of-the-art research and knowledge
, including better data
. It 
c
ould
 also 
provide input to policy makers
 at national and EU level on 
prevention 
gaps and possible solutions to address them.

            

               
3.
Assistance to victims
: the 
c
entre 
c
ould
 work closely with national authorities and global experts to ensure that 
victims
 receive 
appropriate and holistic support
, as the Child Sexual Abuse Directive 
and the Victims Rights Directive

                  

               
 
require

                  

               
.
 It 
c
ould also work on 
supporting 
the 
exchange of best practices
 on protection measures 
for
 
child victims
. 
It 
c
ould 
also support Member States by
 
carrying out research
 (e.g. on short and long-term effects of child sexual abuse on victims) to 
support evidence-based policy
 on assistance and support to victims and serving 
as a hub of expertise
 to help coordinate better and avoid duplication of efforts. 
The 
c
entre could also 
support victims in remov
ing
 their images and videos
 to safeguard their privacy, including through 
proactive
ly
 search
ing
 materials 
online 
and notif
ying 
companies

                  

               
. 

            

               
The centre could 
bring together all the initiatives
 in this strategy by enabling 
more effective cooperation
 between public authorities (including law enforcement), industry and civil society in the EU and globally, and becoming the 
reference entity in the EU for expertise
 in this area:

            

               
·
Legislation-focused initiatives
: 
the 
c
entre
 
c
ould 
assist with its expertise 
the Commission
 
on its role to support 
Member States on the implementation of the Child Sexual Abuse Directive
. 
This expertise
, which 
would 
increase with time as 
the centre
 continues to identify gaps and best practices in the EU and beyond,
 
would 
facilitate 
evidence-based policy
 
by the Commission 
that 
could 
also ensure that EU legislation 
is up to date to enable an effective response
.

            

               
·
Cooperation
 and funding
-focused initiatives
: 
working
 
closely with 
the Commission and 
similar centres in other countries
 and with the WePROTECT Global Alliance
 
to end child sexual exploitation
, the 
c
entre 
c
ould 
ensure that 
all
 
Member State
s
 ha
ve
 
immediate 
and centralised 
access to global best practices
, and that children around the world can benefit from EUs best practices.
 T
he 
c
entre could 
also 
draw on the results of the 
prevention network
, and the experience of the Safer Internet Centres
.

            

               
The Commission will work closely with the European Parliament and Member States to 
explore the various implementation options
, including 
making use of existing structures
 for the centres functions where appropriate, with a view to maximising the centres added-value, effectiveness, and sustainability. The Commission will carry out an

ð
The Commission will 
launch 
immediately
 
a study to 
work towards 
the creation of a European 
centre
 
to prevent and counter child sexual abuse to enable a 
comprehensive and effective
 EU response against child sexual abuse 
online and offline
.

               

               
7.
Galvanise 
industry 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
the protection of 
children 
in 
their
 products
 

            

               
Providers of certain online services are 
uniquely well placed
 to prevent, 
detect and report
 child sexual abuse that occurs using their infrastructure or services. 

            

               
A
t present, 
a number of 
companies 
voluntarily 
detect child sexual abuse
. 
NCMEC
 received 
almost 
17 million
 
reports 
of child sexual abuse
 
from those companies 
in 2019 alone

                  

               
.
 
These reports 
include not only 
abusive 
images and videos but also situations 
that pose an
 
imminent danger to children
 (e.g. 
details of
 
arrangements to 
meet to 
physically abuse the child or suicide threats 
by
 
the child following blackmail by the offender).
 
These reports 
have been 
instrumental
 
for years 
in 
rescuing children in the EU from ongoing abuse
. 
They 
have 
led to, 
for example
: 

            

               
·
the rescue of 11 children, some as young as 2 years old, who were exploited by a network of abusers in Sweden

                  

               
;

            

               
·
the single largest operation ever against child sexual abuse in Denmark

                  

               
;

            

               
·
the rescue of a 9 year-old girl in Romania, who had been abused by her father for more than a year

                  

               
;

            

               
·
the rescue of a 4 year-old girl and her 10 year-old brother in Germany, who had been abuse
d
 by their father

                  

               
;

            

               
·
the arrest of an offender in France who groomed 100 children to obtain child sexual abuse material from them

                  

               
;

            

               
·
the rescue of 2 girls in Czech
ia
, abused by a 52 year-old man, who recorded the abuse and distributed it online

                  

               
.

            

               
The efforts that companies make to detect and report child sexual abuse 
vary
 
significantly
. 
I
n 2019
,
 
a
 single company
, 
Facebook
, 
sent
 
almost 16 million reports (94% of the total that year), 
while 
other 
US-based 
companies sent fewer than 1
 
000 reports, and some fewer than 10

                  

               
.
  

            

               
Last year
,
 Facebook announced plans to implement 
end-to-end encryption
 by default in its instant messaging service. I
n the absence of accompanying measures, i
t is estimated that
 
this could reduce the number of 
total 
reports
 of child sexual abuse
 
in the EU (and globally) 
by 
more than half

                  

               
 and 
as much as t
wo-
thirds

                  

               
, since the detection tools as currently used do not work on end-to-end encrypted communications.

            

               
Given the key role that certain online services play in the distribution of child sexual abuse material, and the actual and potential importance of the industry in the fight against child sexual abuse, it is essential that it 
takes responsibility
 for protecting children in its products, in line with EU fundamental rights, including on privacy and personal data protection. 

            

               
In 2020, t
he Commission 
has begun
 
work
 
on 
support
ing
 industry efforts in the fight against child sexual a
buse 
online 
under the 
EU Internet Forum
. 
The 
f
orum
, which 
brings
 together all E
U 
Home Affairs
 
Ministers, high-level representatives of major 
internet
 companies, the European Parliament 
and 
Europol
, 
has served since 2015 as a model for a successful cross-sector collaboration in the fight against terrorist content
 online
 and 
has 
now expand
ed
 to also cover child sexual abuse online.

                  

               
 
 

            

               
In addition to continuing to support the fight against terrorist content online, the EU Internet Forum will provide a 
common space to share best practices and the challenges
 that private and public actors encounter in their fight against child sexual abuse online, to 
increase mutual understanding and find solutions together
. It will also enable 
high-level political coordination
 to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of actions across the EU.

            

               
One of the specific initiatives under the EU Internet Forum in 2020 is the creation of a technical 
expert process
 to map and assess possible solutions which could allow companies to 
detect and report
 child sexual abuse in 
end-to-end encrypted electronic communications
, in full respect of fundamental rights and without creating new vulnerabilities criminals could exploit. Technical experts from academia, industry, public authorities and civil society organisations will examine possible solutions focused on the device, the server and the encryption protocol that could ensure the privacy and security of electronic communications and the protection of children from sexual abuse and sexual exploitation. 

            

                  
Key action:

               

                  
ð
Under the 
EU Internet Forum
, the Commission 
has
 launch
ed
 an expert process with industry 
to map and preliminar
il
y assess, 
by the end of 2020
, 
possible technical solutions to 
detect and report
 
child sexual abuse in 
end-to-end encrypted electronic communications, 
and to address 
regulatory and operational
 challenges and opportunities in the fight against these crimes.

Improve protection of children globally 
through 
multi-stakeholder cooperation  

            

               
Child sexual abuse is 
a global reality
 across all countries and social groups
 
and it 
happens both 
offline and online
. 
It is estimated that, at any given moment, across the world there are more than 
750
 
000 predators online
 exchanging child sexual abuse material, streaming live abuse of children, extorting children to produce sexual material or grooming children for future sexual abuse

                  

               
.
 

            

               
The following map shows the real time downloads in a given day of 
a sample
 of child sexual abuse material

                  

               
:

            

               

                  

               

            

               
There is also evidence that offenders
 
travel to third
 
countries
 to
 take advantage of more lenient legislative frameworks or fewer
 enforcement capacitie
s and 
to commit abuse without fear
ing 
law enforcement. 
The ability to require those 
who 
commit sexual offences against children to 
register
 and comply with certain conditions imposed by the court or probation services after 
their 
release 
from prison 
plays an important role in protecting children

                  

               
.
 

            

               
The 
Commission
 
has 
supported global efforts
 through multi-stakeholder cooperation

                  

               
 for years
, well aware that 
it takes a network to defeat a network
. 
One 
example
 is the 
 
Commission
-
funded 
ICSE database
, 
hosted at Interpol, 
which holds more than 1.5 million images and videos and has helped identify 
20
 
000 victims worldwide
, through the collaborative efforts of the more than 60 countries (and Europol) that are connected to it

                  

               
.
 
The 
Commission 
also 
co-
funds 
the 
INHOPE
 network of hotlines

                  

               
 
from more than 40 countries to facilitate the removal of child sexual abuse material online
 anonymously reported by 
the 
public

                  

               
.
 
The Commission will continue supporting global action with funding to enhance international cooperation. 
In particular, the EU will continue to support the EU-UN Spotligh
t Initiative

                  

               
, 
to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls across five regions around the globe

                  

               
. 

            

               
In 2012, t
he Commission 
co-founded
 with the 
competent 
US 
authorities
 the Global Alliance 
Against Child Sexual Abuse Online

                  

               
, which 
brought together 
54 countries 
to 
improve
 
victim protection, identify and prosecute offenders, raise awareness, and reduce the availability of child 
sexual abuse material online. 
This initiative merged with a similar one from the UK, WePROTECT, created in 2014, which 
brought 
governments together
 with
 industry and NGOs. In 2016
,
 both initiatives agreed to join 
forces 
and form the 
WePROTECT Global Alliance
 to End Ch
ild Sexual Exploitation Online, which 
currently
 
includes 
97 governments, 
32
 global technology companies
,
 
3
3
 civil society organisations
 and international institutions
, and 
5
 regional organisations

                  

               
.
 
At
 the
 end of 2019, t
he organisation became 
an 
independent legal entity
 in the form of a foundation with limited liability, set up in the Netherlands.
 

            

               
The WePROTECT Global Alliance has advanced countries commitment towards a more coordinated response to the global fight against child sexual abuse, based on global threat assessments, and a model national response. These have helped to clarify the challenges and assist member countries in setting achievable practical goals.

            

               
The 
Commission 
will continue to 
support the 
a
lliance 
as 
a member 
of its 
policy 
board
, given its 
co-founder
 status
, including with funding
.
 
This will allow the 
Commission 
to 
ensure coherence
 with global initiatives
 (in particular regulatory ones)
, 
which 
in turn 
w
ill
 
support and strengthen
 
the effectiveness of 
actions
 
within the EU 
by providing Member States access to global best practices
. 
In particular, by participating in the policy board of the We
PROTECT
 Global Alliance, the Commission actively contributes to 
increase standards for 
the protection of children, the identification of perpetrators, and support for child victims across the globe. 
This facilitates 
the 
EUs efforts to share best practices with and to support national authorities in third countries 
in
 implement
ing
 international standards in the online space (
i
.e
. protection of children), in line with the EU Action Plan on Human 
R
ights and 
D
emocracy 2020-2024

                  

               
.
 
The Commission has supported this type of global cooperation for years and considers
 
the WeP
ROTECT
 Global Alliance as 
the central organisation for coordinating and streamlining 
global
 efforts and regulatory improvements, and bringing about a more effective global response.

            

                  
Key action:

               

                  
ð
The Commission will continue contributing to 
increase global standards
 for the protection of children against sexual abuse by promoting multi-stakeholder cooperation through the 
WeP
ROTECT
 Global Alliance
, and through dedicated 
funding
. 

               

               
NEXT STEPS

            

               
This strategy presents a framework to respond in a comprehensive way to the increasing threat of child sexual abuse, both in its 
online and offline
 form. This strategy will be the reference framework for EU action in the fight against child sexual abuse for the 
2020-2025
 period. It will also inform related Commission initiatives such as the 
EU strategy on the rights of the child
, to be adopted in early 2021. 

            

               
The Commission will 
work closely
 with companies, civil society organisations, academia, practitioners, researchers, law enforcement and other public authorities, and other relevant stakeholders, in the EU (including the European Parliament and the Council) and globally, during the coming months and years to ensure an 
effective exploration and implementation
 of the 
eight initiatives presented in the strategy
. 

            

               
The right 
legal framework
 should be implemented to enable an effective response, including on investigations, prevention and assistance to victims, by the relevant actors, including companies.

            

               
Child sexual abuse is a complex issue that requires the 
maximum cooperation 
from all stakeholders, which have to be able, willing, and ready to act. The Commission will 
spare no efforts
 to ensure that this is the case, given the 
urgent need
 to take 
effective action
. 

            

               
Our children are our present and our future
. The Commission will continue using all available tools to ensure that 
nothing steals that future
 from them.

This strategy refers to child sexual abuse for simplicity but it should be understood as covering also child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse material (referred to in legislation as child pornography).

                  

                     

                  

                     
 

                        
   
As reported to the US 

                     

                     
. US law requires internet companies based in the US to report to NCMEC any instances of child sexual abuse that they find in their networks. NCMEC then forwards those reports to the relevant public authorities around the world for action. As the largest internet companies are based in the US, NCMEC de facto centralises the reporting of child sexual abuse globally.

 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code, OJ L 321, 17.12.2018 This Directive extends the scope of the e-privacy Directive to over the top (OTT) inter-personal communication services such as messenger services and email. 
The ePrivacy Directive does not contain a legal basis for voluntary processing of content and traffic data for the purpose of detecting 
child sexual abuse
. Providers can 
only 
apply such measures if 
based on 
a national legislative measure, that meets the requirements of Article 15 of the Directive (proportionality etc.), 
for

ing 
the right to confidentiality. In the absence of such legislative measures, measures 
to detect child sexual abuse 
undertaken by these providers, which process content or traffic data, would lack a legal basis.

Commission funding to the hotlines and to the central hashes database ICCAM is currently provided under Connecting Europe Facility; future funding has been proposed by the Commission under Digital Europe Programme. The hotlines analyse the reports and the location of hosting service providers, and forward details of confirmed CSAM to the relevant law enforcement agency, for criminal investigation and victim identification, and to the hosting service providers for content removal.
