(4)
The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes an unexpected and unprecedented emergency that deeply affects all Member States and obliges them to take immediate action at national level to deal with the ongoing crisis as a priority by reallocating resources reserved for other issues. As a result of this crisis, several Member States are encountering difficulties in finalising the development of IT systems necessary for the application of Regulation (EU) 2017/2454 as of 1 January 2021. Some Member States have therefore asked for the postponement of the dates of application of Regulation (EU) 2017/2454.
(5)

(6)
In view of the significant impact of the economic disturbances and possible additional difficulties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and in order to support the correct and timely application of the new VAT e-commerce rules, the Commission could work closely with the Member States concerned to monitor the adaptation of the national IT systems and to provide technical assistance whenever needed.
(7)
Regulation (EU) 2017/2454 should therefore be amended accordingly,
