of 14 December 2020
amending Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/532 as regards a derogation from Implementing Regulation (EU) No 809/2014 for checks by monitoring relating to aid applications for area-related aid schemes and payment claims for area-related support measures
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 352/78, (EC) No 165/94, (EC) No 2799/98, (EC) No 814/2000, (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 485/2008 
1
, and in particular points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/532 
2
 contains certain derogations from, inter alia, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 809/2014 
3
 as regards certain administrative and on-the-spot checks applicable within the common agricultural policy.
(2)
Certain elements of checks by monitoring implemented under Article 40a of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 809/2014 require visits in the field. However, due to movement restrictions put in place to address the pandemic of COVID-19, in the year 2020 Member States may not be in a position to carry out those checks as required by that Article. Therefore it is appropriate to provide for a derogation from certain provisions of that Article.
(3)
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/532 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(4)
As this Regulation provides for an additional derogation from Implementing Regulation (EU) No 809/2014 in respect of claim year 2020 due to the pandemic of COVID-19, it should enter into force on the day of its publication in the 
Official Journal of the European Union
 and apply retroactively from the same date as Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/532.
(5)
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Direct Payments and the Rural Development Committee,
