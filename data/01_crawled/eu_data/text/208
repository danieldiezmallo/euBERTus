RECOMMENDATION OF THE EUROPEAN SYSTEMIC RISK BOARD
of 27 May 2020
on restriction of distributions during the COVID-19 pandemic
(ESRB/2020/7)
(2020/C 212/01)
THE GENERAL BOARD OF THE EUROPEAN SYSTEMIC RISK BOARD,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on European Union macroprudential oversight of the financial system and establishing a European Systemic Risk Board 
1
, and in particular Article 3(2)(b), (d) and (f) and Articles 16 to 18 thereof,
Having regard to Decision ESRB/2011/1 of the European Systemic Risk Board of 20 January 2011 adopting the Rules of Procedure of the European Systemic Risk Board 
2
, and in particular Article 15(3)(e) and Articles 18 to 20 thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has developed rapidly from a dramatic medical emergency into a severe economic shock, which has the potential to evolve into a systemic financial crisis. It is neither certain for how long this crisis will last, nor how severe it may be. It is clear that there is a need for financial institutions to maintain a sufficiently high amount of capital to mitigate systemic risk and contribute to economic recovery.
(2)
A number of European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) member institutions, namely the European Banking Authority 
3
 (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority 
4
 (EIOPA), the European Central Bank 
5
 (ECB) and many national authorities have encouraged banks, insurers and reinsurers in the Union to refrain from making voluntary pay-outs (e.g. dividends, bonuses, and share buybacks aimed at remunerating shareholders). These measures can enhance the resilience of the financial sector, strengthening its capacity to lend to the real economy in stressed conditions and reducing the risk of failures of financial institutions due to COVID-19 related risks.
(3)
The ESRB is responsible for the macroprudential oversight of the financial system within the Union and should contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market thereby ensuring a sustainable contribution of the financial sector to economic growth. Whilst the ESRB welcomes and fully supports the initiatives of its member institutions, it also considers it necessary to issue a recommendation to ensure that financial institutions across the financial sector that may pose a risk to financial stability maintain high levels of capital.
(4)
This Recommendation acknowledges the procyclical behaviour of banks, as well as the fact that they play a critical function in the economy. It aims at limiting banks’ profit and capital distribution in order to increase their resilience during the crisis and promote necessary lending to the real economy. It also aims at reducing the risk that in instances where governments support banks during the crisis, shareholders and senior management shift capital allocation for their own benefit. In addition, if banks use dividend payments as a signal of strength to the market, such actions could undermine the relative position of more prudent financial institutions that may become stigmatised. The latter argument speaks in favour of broad-based, coordinated and mandatory action. Investment firms are included in the list of financial institutions under this Recommendation, as they play an important role in market functioning and may present similar risks to banks.
(5)
This Recommendation recognises the risk imposed by this crisis on the solvency of insurers and reinsurers. It is probable that there will be a reduction in cash flows from new business, combined with higher liabilities due to an extended period of very low interest rates and lower asset returns in the future. Given that insurers and reinsurers play a critical role in the financial sector there is also the risk of a common de-risking strategy, such as the sale of higher-yield corporate bonds, which would be amplified by large scale downgrades. In addition, the same argument raised for banks concerning dividend payments being a signal of strength to the market and the associated stigma of restrictions also pertains to insurers and reinsurers.
(6)
This Recommendation is designed to cover central counterparties (CCPs) given their systemically important role in clearing financial market transactions. By maintaining additional own resources, CCPs would be able to meet non-default losses, which is particularly relevant with regard to operational risk, which CCPs cover with their own resources rather than contributions from clearing members. This Recommendation will ensure consistency across financial institutions at a time where CCPs revenues might benefit from higher market transactions volumes, and where relevant, will allow CCPs to increase their skin-in-the-game in the default waterfall on a voluntary basis, in light of generally increased risks due to higher market volatility. Finally, it is envisaged that the maintenance of own funds in CCPs would reduce the likelihood of recourse to tax-payers money in case of losses (related or not to defaults) in a time where fiscal spending is already particularly under pressure. Overall, it is important for CCPs to maintain adequate prefunded own resources in addition to initial margins and default funds.
(7)
This Recommendation intends to cover those actions by financial institutions that result in a reduction in the amount and quality of their own funds or in a reduction of their loss absorbing capacity for the duration of the COVID-19 related crisis. This includes payment of dividends, buy-backs of ordinary shares and paying variable remuneration. If a financial institution wanted to replace ordinary shares, this would be in compliance with this Recommendation.
(8)
This Recommendation acknowledges the principles governing the Single Market and the growth-enhancing role of free capital movement and risk sharing within the Union. It aims to account for risks of potential negative externalities arising from cross-border financial institution decisions during distressed times. A flight to safety or a home-bias as often realised during times of financial distress can have negative effects on local economies. This Recommendation advocates that the relevant authorities enter a dialogue when considering imposing pay-out restrictions on subsidiaries of Union financial institutions.
(9)
Regulatory regimes vary across sectors and Member States and relevant authorities should consider using any supervisory tool available to them, both under Union and national law, such as recommendations or guidelines, to achieve the objectives of this Recommendation, to the extent permitted by law.
(10)
This Recommendation provides for a list of financial institutions which should, as a minimum, be subject to the restrictions. Authorities are free to impose the restrictions on other financial institutions that provide lending to the real economy, such as financial leasing companies.
(11)
This Recommendation is designed to support the previous initiatives of the ECB, EBA, EIOPA and national authorities and to strengthen the case for a uniform approach across the Union and across different segments of the financial sector, whilst taking into account the critical role of these segments for the real economy during crisis times. The ultimate aim is to have sufficient levels of capital and loss absorbing capacity remaining in the financial institutions to mitigate the impact of the current crisis and thereby contribute to a smoother recovery for the pan-European economy as a whole.
(12)
This Recommendation is without prejudice to the monetary policy mandates of the central banks in the Union.
(13)
Recommendations of the ESRB are published after the addressees have been informed, and after the General Board has informed the Council of the European Union of its intention to do so and provided the Council with an opportunity to react,
HAS ADOPTED THIS RECOMMENDATION:

RECOMMENDATION
