COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2020/595
of 30 April 2020
granting aid for private storage for sheepmeat and goatmeat and fixing the amount of the aid in advance
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007 
1
, and in particular Article 18(2) and Article 223(3)(c) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013 of 16 December 2013 determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products 
2
 and in particular Article 4(2)(b) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 352/78, (EC) No 165/94, (EC) No 2799/98, (EC) No 814/2000, (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 485/2008 
3
, and in particular Article 62(2)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Due to the extensive movement restrictions put in place in the Member States to address the current COVID-19 pandemic, the sales of certain categories of sheep and goat products such as the lamb and goat carcases aged less than 12 months to the hospitality and catering industry have been severely impacted.
(2)
As a result, there has been a sharp drop in demand for certain sheep and goat products. The sheep and goat sector is therefore confronted with a market disturbance due to supply-demand imbalance. This has a significant negative impact on the margins in the sector and compromises the financial viability of the Union farmers. Without measures against this market disturbance, the prices of sheep and goat products in the Union are expected to deteriorate and downwards pressure is likely to carry on.
(3)
The current supply-demand imbalance in the sheep and goat meat markets can be mitigated by storage of ovine and caprine carcases aged less than 12 months that would have been destined in majority to the hospitality and catering industry.
(4)
The extensive movement restrictions put in place in the Member States to address the current COVID-19 pandemic have also affected the availability of labour force in slaughterhouses and food processing and reduced the capacities in transport and logistics.
(5)
In order to mitigate the current difficulties and in particular to reduce the supply-demand imbalance, which in turn exerts a downward pressure on all sheep and goat meat product prices, and to alleviate those difficult market conditions, it is appropriate to grant private storage aid for fresh or chilled meat of ovine and caprine animals aged less than 12 months.
(6)
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1238 
4
 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1240 
5
 lay down rules for the implementation of the aid for private storage. Save as otherwise provided in this Regulation, the provisions of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1238 and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1240 should apply to the private storage aid for fresh and chilled meat of ovine and caprine animals aged less than 12 months.
(7)
The amount of the aid should be fixed in advance so as to allow for a rapid and flexible operational system. In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013, the aid for private storage fixed in advance should be based on storage costs and other relevant market elements. It is appropriate to fix an aid for the total storage period based on the costs for placing in and removal of storage, cold storage costs per day and the partial compensation for the loss of value from fresh or chilled to frozen sheep and goat meat.
(8)
For private storage aid to be effective and have a real impact on the market, the aid should be granted only for the products that have not yet been placed in storage. In that context, it is appropriate to fix the period of storage.
(9)
For reasons of administrative efficiency and simplification, the minimum quantity of products to be covered by each application should be fixed.
(10)
A security should be fixed in order to guarantee the seriousness of the application and to ensure that the measure will have the desired effect on the market.
(11)
The measures put in place to address the COVID-19 pandemic may affect compliance with the requirements for on-the-spot checks concerning aid for private storage pursuant to Article 60 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1240. It is appropriate to provide flexibility to the Member States concerned by those measures, by prolonging the period for carrying out the entry into storage checks or by substituting them by the use of other relevant evidence, and by not requiring the carrying out of unannounced checks. It is therefore appropriate to derogate from certain provisions of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1240 for the purposes of this Regulation.
(12)
Article 42(1)(b) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1240 provides that Member States should notify the Commission of admissible applications once per week. In order to ensure transparency, monitoring and proper administration of the amounts available for the aid, more frequent notifications are necessary for the effective managing the scheme.
(13)
In order to have an immediate impact on the market and to contribute to stabilise prices, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the 
Official Journal of the European Union
.
(14)
