Both annual and cumulative values are compulsory. In case the annual value cannot be provided (e.g. because percentages are reported and the denominator would be zero), the annual value is n.a. Cumulative values of indicators expressed in absolute numbers and percentages in relation to the reference output indicators are calculated automatically.
