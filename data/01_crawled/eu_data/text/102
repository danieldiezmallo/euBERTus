COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2020/597
of 30 April 2020
granting aid for private storage for butter and fixing the amount of aid in advance
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007 
1
, and in particular Article 18(2) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013 of 16 December 2013 determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of the markets in agricultural products 
2
, and in particular Article 4(2)(b) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 352/78, (EC) No 165/94, (EC) No 2799/98, (EC) No 814/2000, (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 485/2008 
3
, and in particular Article 62(2)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Due to the current pandemic of COVID-19 and the extensive movement restrictions put in place in the Member States there has been a drop in demand for certain products in the milk and milk products sector. The spread of the disease and the measures in place limit the availability of labour, compromising notably the stages of production, collection and processing of milk. Furthermore, the mandatory closure of shops, outdoor markets, restaurants and other hospitality establishments has brought the operation of the hospitality and catering industry to a halt, leading to significant changes in the demand patterns for milk and milk products. The hospitality and catering industry is traditionally responsible for the consumption of approximately between 10 and 20 %, depending on the product, of the Union milk and milk products production. In addition, buyers in the Union and on the world market are cancelling contracts and delaying the conclusion of new ones in anticipation of further price falls.
(2)
As a result, the processing of raw milk intake is partially being diverted into bulk, long shelf life, storable products that are less labour intense, such as skimmed milk powder and butter, beyond the regular market demand.
(3)
In order to reduce the resulting supply-demand imbalance, it is appropriate to grant private storage aid for butter.
(4)
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1238 
4
 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1240 
5
 lay down rules for the implementation of the aid for private storage. Save as otherwise provided in this Regulation, the provisions of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1238 and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1240 should apply to the private storage aid for butter.
(5)
The amount of the aid should be fixed in advance so as to allow for a rapid and flexible operational system. In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013, the aid for private storage fixed in advance should be based on storage costs and other relevant market elements. It is appropriate to set an aid for fixed storage costs for entry and exit of the products concerned and an aid per day of storage for costs for storage and financing.
(6)
For reasons of administrative efficiency and simplification, applications should only refer to butter already in storage and a security should not be required. In that context, it is appropriate to fix the period of storage.
(7)
For reasons of administrative efficiency and simplification, the minimum quantity of products to be covered by each application should be fixed.
(8)
The measures put in place to address the pandemic of COVID-19 may affect compliance with the requirements for on-the-spot checks concerning aid for private storage pursuant to Article 60 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1240. It is appropriate to provide flexibility to the Member States concerned by those measures, by prolonging the period for carrying out the entry into storage checks or by substituting them by the use of other relevant evidence, and by not requiring the carrying out of unannounced checks. It is therefore appropriate to derogate from certain provisions of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1240 for the purposes of this Regulation.
(9)
In order to have an immediate impact on the market and to contribute to stabilise prices, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the 
Official Journal of the European Union
.
(10)
