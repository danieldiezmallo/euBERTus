Proposal for a
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
amending Regulation (EC) N° 1257/96 of 20 June 1996 concerning Humanitarian Aid       

               
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

            

               
1.
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

            

                  
The Coronavirus disease outbreak ("COVID-19") has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. Since then, countries across the world have adopted extraordinary measures to respond to and contain the outbreak.

               

                  
The COVID-19 pandemic crisis is having a major impact on societies around the globe, starting with health systems, and moving to severe global social and economic consequences. This poses important challenge to third countries with weak institutions and/or facing conflicts or other crises such as natural disasters. Vulnerable groups including refugees and displaced persons may be in particular risk. The response strategy of the Union should be comprehensive, coherent and integrated, tackling the public health and the socio-economic challenges as well as responding to immediate humanitarian needs created or aggravated by the pandemic. 

               

                  
This exceptional situation calls for a coherent and unified approach at the level of the Union. Therefore, substantial amounts of public and private investment are needed to find solutions to the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak. 

               

                  
The Commission therefore proposes an ambitious package including a proposal to establish a European Union Recovery Instrument. In addition to the support to economies both within the EU as well as in third countries, the instrument should also reinforce EU humanitarian assistance and support capacity building to enhance future crisis prevention and preparedness. 

               

                  
It is proposed that those measures are carried out under specific Union instruments and programmes in accordance with the relevant Union acts laying down rules for those instruments and programmes. 

               

               
It is therefore necessary to enable the implementation of those measures through the delivery mechanisms under Regulation (EC) No 1257/96 of 20 June 1996 concerning humanitarian aid.

Proposal for a

            

               
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

            

               
amending Regulation (EC) N° 1257/96 of 20 June 1996 concerning Humanitarian Aid       

            

               
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

            

               
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and in particular Article 214(3) thereof,

            

               
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

            

               
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

            

               
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

            

               
Whereas:

            

               
(1)
The Covid-19 pandemic crisis is having a major impact on societies around the globe, starting with health systems, and moving to severe global social and economic consequences 
as well as creating and aggravating humanitarian needs.
 

            

               
(2)
Third countries with weak state institutions are particularly vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic. This will lead/has led to a rising demand on 
humanitarian
 actors to provide an immediate, effective, efficient and coherent response and to support third country local communities. The response strategy of the Union should be comprehensive, coherent and integrated, tackling the public health, the socio-economic challenges as well as addressing humanitarian challenges. In particular, vulnerable countries and populations are at risk and in need of assistance, relief and protection.     

            

               
(3)
In accordance with Regulation [European Union Recovery Instrument] and within the limits of resources allocated therein, recovery and resilience measures under Humanitarian Aid should be carried out to address the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 crisis.  Such additional resources should be used in such a way as to ensure compliance with the time limits provided for in Regulation [ERI].   

            

               
(4)
Regulation (EC) 
1257/96 
should therefore be amended accordingly,

Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative

            

                  
This targeted amendment of the Humanitarian aid Regulation is proposed within the framework of the revised MFF (2021-2027) proposal including the European Recovery Instrument. This new instrument will provide funds to the Humanitarian aid, along with other programmes, for a limited period of time above the ceilings set for commitment and payment appropriations  by the MFF, as external assigned revenue under the meaning of Article 21 of the Financial Regulation. 

               

                  
The implementation of the relevant actions under Humanitarian aid shall aim at supporting third countries in overcoming the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and promoting resilience.

               

               
1.4.2.
Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.

            

                  
(1)

                     
   
The spread of the Coronavirus disease (‘COVID-19’), which on 11 March 2020 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization has put an enormous strain on third countries, in particular on countries facing conflicts or other types of crises. In addition, in order to contain the spread, third countries have adopted a set of unprecedented measures. Those measures have caused significant disturbances of economic activities posing additional challenges to already weakened systems in some of the countries. In particular, those measures have disrupted supply chains and production and have caused absences from the workplace. More broadly, those measures have already led to or will lead to severe deterioration of the financial situation of many businesses in third countries. 

               

                  
(2)

                     
   
The crisis has spread quickly in the territory of the Union and in third countries. A sharp contraction of growth across the globe is now foreseen for 2020 and may last into 2021. This may have particularly dire consequences for third countries and their populations or vulnerable groups (e.g. refugees), in particular if combined with other challenges such as conflicts, natural disasters or break down of health systems in third countries.

               

                  
(3)

                     
   
This exceptional situation calls for a coherent and unified approach at the level of the Union to prevent further deterioration of the economy and to boost a balanced recovery of the economic activity, ensuring continuity and increase in investments for the green and digitil transistion. Furthemore, due to major implications for third countries or vulnerable groups facing other challenges such as conflict, poverty, natural disaster, it is therefore necessary to establish an EU Recovery Instrument to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic or the immediate funding needs to avoid its re-emergence. 

               

                  
(5) In addition to the support to economies both within the EU as well as in third countries, to health and climate related research and innovation activities within the Union, the instrument should reinforce the support that the EU can provide in cases of humanitarian needs. 

               

                  
(6) The overall humanitarian situation, as well as trade and economic relations with neighbouring and developing countries are of high relevance for the economy in the Union. For that reason, and in line with the global role and responsibility of the Union as well as its values, financial resources from the EU Recovery Instrument via NDICI should also be used to provide support for the efforts of those countries to fight the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and recover from it. It should also be used, via Humanitarian aid, to provide humanitarian relief to populations in need, including much needed support to the health services of third countries. 

               

               
1.4.3.
Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past

            

                  
Experience from the MFF 2014–2020 shows that the Humanitarian aid annual allocations have been insufficient to cover the numerous protracting or newly emerging humanitarian crises in the world. For this reason, extensive reinforcements through the use of the Emergency Aid Reserve and other sources had to be made. This proposal responds to the additional unforeseen needs related to COVID-19 by increasing the availability of additional resources over and above the MFF 2021-2027 amounts.

               

               
1.4.4.
Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments

            

                  
In addition to the synergies with the NDICI, the current initiative in the context of the revised MFF proposal sets strong synergies between Humanitarian aid and the new European Recovery Instrument, set out by the proposed Regulation (EU) XXX/XX. The latter will allow to provide funds to these sectorial programmes for a limited period of time above the ceilings of the MFF as a result of the complementarity of objectivities and functioning of these instruments and in light of rationale and added value presented in the section 1.4.2. above.

The Commission regularly assesses humanitarian aid operations in order to establish whether they have achieved their objectives and to produce guidelines for improving the effectiveness of subsequent operations. The Commission reports to the Committee established in accordance with Article 17 of the Regulation.

Management and control system(s)
 

            

                  
In order to ensure transparency and accountability on how European aid funds were spent, at the end of each year the European Commission's department for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) establishes an annual report. The report is available to the public, presenting how the budget was spent and which activities were carried out. ECHO is regularly subject to an annual detailed review of procedures and validation of its expenditure. 

                  
Audits

                  
 are carried out by the European Court of Auditors, as well as the Internal Audit Service of the Commission. 
ECHO also carries out partners' audits to assess whether grants have been spent in accordance with laid down rules, and to provide recommendations to improve the financial management by partners.

Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities
 

            

               
Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the Anti-Fraud Strategy.

            

                  
ECHO has in place an Anti-Fraud Strategy. The Strategy covers all key areas such as all stages of the anti-fraud cycle (prevention, detection, correction); internal fraud and external fraud; all activities of the DG, in particular Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection actions; direct and indirect management modes; and fraud-proofing of legislation.
