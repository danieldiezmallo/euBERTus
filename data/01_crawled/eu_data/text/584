Proposal for a
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
amending Regulation (EC) No 851/2004 establishing a European Centre for disease prevention and control

               
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

            

               
1.
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

            

               
•
Reasons for and objectives of the proposal

            

               
As a building block of the European Health Union, this proposal reinforces the mandate of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (‘the Centre’) addressing surveillance, preparedness, early warning and response under a strengthened EU health security framework. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed shortcomings in Union mechanisms for managing health threats, which call for a more structured Union-level approach, which is also built on the European value of solidarity, to future health crises. This should include a reinforced role for the Centre. It should also take a One-Health approach, together with other relevant EU Agencies, to the issue, considering the interactions between humans, animals and the environment.

            

               
The Centre’s mandate, established by Regulation (EC) No 851/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council

                  

               
, was adopted before the mechanisms and structures under the current EU health security framework under Decision 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border threats to health

                  

               
.

            

               
Given the review of this framework, the Centre’s founding regulation needs to be amended, to ensure consistency with other Union instruments and 
with the proposal for an amending Regulation on serious cross-border threats to health.
 The review will also ensure that the Centre fully complies with the ‘common approach’ for decentralised agencies, as laid down in the ‘Joint Statement of the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and the European Commission on decentralized agencies’

                  

               
.

            

               
•
Consistency with existing Union measures in this field

            

               
The proposal is part of a package of closely associated measures, and forms part of the Union’s overall health response to COVID-19 as well as an improved crisis management framework. 

            

               
The amendments proposed will therefore be in compliance with the ‘common approach’ for decentralised agencies, from 2012. 

            

               
•
Consistency with other Union policies

            

               
This proposal is in line with the Union’s overarching objectives, including a stronger health Union, a smooth functioning of the single market, complementarity with the Union Civil Protection Mechanism, sustainable and resilient health systems, and an ambitious research and innovation agenda. In addition, it will provide useful input to and synergies with the EU Digital Single Market agenda and the future European Health Data Space, encouraging innovation and research, facilitating information sharing (including of real-time data), and supporting the development of EU-level IT infrastructure for epidemiological surveillance and monitoring. 

            

               
2.
LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY

            

               
•
Legal basis

            

               
The proposed Regulation is based on Article 168(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This approach is based on the specific objectives of the proposal, namely to adopt measures to protect and improve human health and in particular combating major cross-border health threats, especially through monitoring and early warning.

            

               
•
Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence)
 

            

               
Although the Member States are responsible for managing public health crises at national level, no country can tackle a cross-border public health crisis alone. Under Article 2(5) TFEU, the Union has competence to carry out measures to support, coordinate or supplement actions by Member States, without thereby superseding their competence in this area.

            

               
Serious cross-border threats to health have, by their nature, transnational implications. In a globalised society, people and goods are moving across borders in high numbers, facilitating illnesses and contaminated products to circulate rapidly across the globe. Public health measures at national level therefore need to be consistent with each other and be coordinated to contain any further spread and minimise the consequences of these threats.

            

               
Public health emergencies of the magnitude of COVID-19 have an impact on all Member States. The proposal builds on lessons learnt during the COVID-19 crisis, and proposes to strengthen the existing Union level structures and mechanisms for improved levels of protection, prevention, preparedness and response, against all health hazards across the EU.

            

               
Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone due to the cross-border dimension of the threats described and can, therefore, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).

            

               
•
Proportionality

            

               
The proposal constitutes a proportionate and necessary response to the problems described in section 1. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5(4) TEU, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.

            

               
•
Choice of the instrument

            

               
The proposal takes the form of an amendment of the existing Regulation. This type of instrument is considered most suitable, considering that a key element of the proposal is to establish well-aligned procedures and structures for joint work at Union level, focussing on giving additional tasks to the Centre. The measures do not require the implementation of national measures and can be directly applicable.

RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

            

               
•
Ex-post evaluations/fitness checks of existing legislation

            

               
As part of a package of urgent measures based on lessons learnt so far from COVID-19, the initiative is supported by the findings of the recent evaluation of the functioning of the Centre

                  

               
, by an assessment of data collected and by exchanges held with public and private stakeholders on issues encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic and possible means to address them. Due consideration is given also to the findings of the Court of Auditors’ Report on the EU health security framework

                  

               
. 
This information is summarised in the Commission Communication accompanying the whole package. 
Considering that the initiative proposes to enlarge the scope of existing legislation, it will not be based on an ex-post evaluation, as the needs identified where not addressed by the existing framework.

            

               
It is proposed that the Commission will report, by 2023, on the Centre’s activities, including an analysis of how the amended mandate has been implemented, the interaction and consistency of the Centre’s activities with the proposed Regulation on serious cross-border threats to health, and, by 2028, possible amendments to the mandate of the Centre. This will also include an analysis of the Centre’s relevance in relation to international, Union and national health priorities, as well as the relationship between the Centre’s outputs and Member States’ capacities. This report will be accompanied by a study, commissioned by the Commission. Moreover, every five years the Commission will evaluate the Centre's performance in relation to its objectives, mandate, tasks, procedure and location, in accordance with Commission Better Regulation guidelines.

            

               
•
Stakeholder consultations

            

               
At the informal Health Council meeting on 16 July 2020, Germany’s Presidency of the Council of the EU chaired a discussion about strengthening the Centre. Member States showed support for an initiative directed at doing so as part of the overall EU health crisis preparedness and response mechanism. This implies an amendment of the Centre’s founding Regulation. The informal Health Council Working Party on Public Health on 29 October 2020 further discussed draft Council conclusions on COVID-19 lessons learnt in health. Bilateral meetings at political and technical levels were further held, and a public webinar was organized on 29 October to discuss the package. 

            

               
•
Impact assessment

            

               
Due to its urgent nature, this proposal is not accompanied by a formal impact assessment. Instead, the changes are mainly based on an assessment of the data collected during the first months of the pandemic and exchanges with public and private stakeholders on COVID-19 issues and possible means to address them and are based on the findings of a recent evaluation. This information has been summarised in a Commission Communication that accompanies the overall package of proposals providing or referring to all available evidence, given that a public consultation and an impact assessment could not be delivered in the timeframe available prior to the adoption of this proposal. 

            

               
•
Fundamental rights

            

               
The proposal contributes to achieving a high level of human, gender-sensitive, health protection, as well as to upholding the highest standards in the protection of human rights and civil liberties, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the European Pillar of Social Rights, during health crisis. Where personal data is processed under this Regulation as proposed, it will be done in accordance with the relevant Union legislation on personal data protection, in particular Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and Regulation (EU) 2016/679. 

            

               
4.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

            

               
The implementation of this proposal has no impact on the current Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. 

            

               
The financial impact of this proposal on the Union budget will be part of the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. 

            

               
The budgetary implications are mainly related to the following objectives:

            

               

setting-up a new vaccine monitoring platform hosted jointly by the European Medicines Agency and the Centre;

Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal

            

               
The proposal aims to provide reinforced capacities of the Centre, to support preparedness, surveillance, risk assessment, and early warning and response to face future cross-border health threats. 

            

               
Key areas of the proposal:

            

               

situational awareness: rapid digitalisation of integrated surveillance systems; 

            

               

better preparedness in Member States: develop prevention and response plans against future epidemics and stronger capacities for integrated rapid epidemic and outbreak response;

            

               

reinforced measures to control epidemics and outbreaks: provision of non-binding recommendations for risk management;

            

               

expanded capacity to mobilise and deploy the EU Health Task Force to assist the response in Member States;

            

               

reinforced capacity and building key competences to monitor and assess health systems capacity for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of specific communicable diseases as well as patient safety;

            

               

reinforced capacity and to identify population groups at risk and in need of targeted prevention and response measures;

            

               

linking research and preparedness and response: liaise between public health and research communities, contribute to defining research priorities related to preparedness and response, ensure integration of research findings in policy recommendations;

            

               

building up the key competences for health protection in Member States: the Centre will be tasked with coordinating a new network of Union reference laboratories for public health and a new network of national services supporting transfusion, transplantation and medically assisted reproduction;

            

               

expanding work on the prevention of communicable diseases and specific health issues, e.g., antimicrobial resistance, vaccination and biosecurity;

            

               

reinforcing the contribution to the EU’s international cooperation and development and EU commitment to global health security preparedness.

            

               
The proposal will also seek to ensure smooth cooperation during such emergencies between the Centre and the EU’s other decentralised agencies, most notably with the European Medicines Agency. 

            

               
This proposal is aligned with the Common Approach

                  

               
 regarding structure and governance, its operations, programming and accountability.

Proposal for a

            

               
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

            

               
amending Regulation (EC) No 851/2004 establishing a European Centre for disease prevention and control

            

               
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

            

               
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 168(5) thereof,

            

               
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

            

               
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

            

               
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

                  

               
, 

            

               
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions

                  

               
, 

            

               
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

            

               
Whereas:

            

               
(1)
The Union is committed to protect and improve human health, in particular to combat the major cross-border health scourges, measures concerning monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health. 

            

               
(2)
Regulation (EC) No 851/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council

                  

               
 established an independent European agency – the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (the ‘Centre’) with the mission to identify, assess and communicate current and emerging threats to human health from communicable diseases. 

            

               
(3)
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. From the challenges experienced in responding to the pandemic it became clear that the Centre’s role in the Union’s 
framework for health crisis preparedness and response 
should be strengthened
. 

            

               
(4)
A joint opinion issued by The European Commission’s Group of Chief Scientific Advisors, the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies , and the Special Advisor to the President of the European Commission on the response to COVID-19 recommends ‘establishing a standing EU advisory body for health threats and crises‘.

            

               
(5)
This Regulation accordingly expands the mission and tasks of the Centre to enhance the Centre’s capacity to provide the required scientific expertise and to support actions which are relevant to the prevention, preparedness, response planning and combating serious cross-border threats to health in the Union in accordance with Regulation EU …/… of the European Parliament and of the Council

                  

               
 [ISC/2020/12524]. 

            

               
(6)
In this respect, the Centre should be tasked with providing epidemiological information and its analysis, epidemiological modelling, anticipation and forecasting, relevant risk assessments and recommendations, which set out options for prevention and control of communicable diseases. Its actions should be consistent with a One-Health approach, recognising the interconnections between human and animal health and the environment. It should monitor the capacity of the national health systems to respond to communicable disease threats, in particular given the importance of this information in the preparation of the national preparedness and response plans. The Centre should support the implementation of actions funded by the relevant Union funding programmes and instruments and related to communicable diseases, provide guidelines for treatment and case management based on a thorough assessment of the latest evidence, support epidemic and outbreak responses in Member States and third countries, including field response, and provide timely objective, reliable and easily accessible information on communicable diseases to the public. The Centre should also establish clear procedures for cooperation with the public health actors in third countries, as well as international organisations competent in the field of public health hence
 contributing to EU’s commitment to reinforcing partners’ preparedness and response capacity.

            

               
(7)
To effectively support the work of the Centre and ensure the fulfilment of its mission, Member States should be tasked to communicate to the Centre data on the surveillance of communicable diseases and other special health issues such as antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections related to communicable diseases, available scientific and technical data and information relevant to the Centre’s mission, to notify the Centre of any serious cross-border threats to health, information on preparedness and response planning and health system capacity, and provide relevant information that may be useful for coordinating the response, as well as identify recognised competent bodies and public health experts available to assist in Union responses to health threats.

            

               
(8)
To enhance 
preparedness and 
response planning
 activities in the Union,
 the Centre’s operation of dedicated networks and networking activities should be broadened to reflect the scope of Regulation (EU) …/…. [OJ: 
please, insert reference
 to Regulation SCBTH [ISC/2020/12524]]. To this end, the Centre should coordinate and provide technical and scientific expertise to the Commission and Member States through dedicated networks with competent coordinating bodies, including newly established networks for laboratories and for supporting transfusion, transplantation and medically assisted reproduction,

            

               
(9)
With a view to enhance the effectiveness of epidemiological surveillance of communicable diseases and of the related special health issues in the Union, the Centre should be tasked with the further development of digital platforms and applications, supporting epidemiological surveillance at Union level, enabling the use of digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, in the compilation and analysis of data, and providing Member States with technical and scientific advice to establish integrated epidemiological surveillance systems. Such digital platforms and applications should be developed with integrated EU space generated data with the intention to be integrate them in the future European Health Data Space as governed by the Union legislation.

            

               
(10)
To strengthen the capacity of the Union and Member States to assess the epidemiological situation and perform accurate risk assessment and response, the Centre should in particular monitor and report on trends in communicable diseases, support and facilitate evidence-based response action, provide recommendations for improvement of communicable disease prevention and control programmes established at the national and Union level, monitor and assess the capacity of national health systems for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of communicable diseases, including in a gender-sensitive way, identify population groups at risk requiring specific measures, analyse the correlation of disease incidence with societal and environmental factors, and identify risk factors for transmission and disease severity of communicable diseases, and identify research needs and priorities. The Centre should work with nominated national focal points for surveillance, forming a network that strategically advises the Centre on such matters and would promote the use of enabling sectors, such as EU space data and services.

            

               
(11)
The Centre should help strengthen the capacity within the Union to 
diagnose
, detect, identify and characterise infectious agents which may threaten public health by ensuring the operation of the network of Union reference laboratories in accordance with Regulation (EU) …/… [OJ: 
please, insert reference to Regulation SCBTH
 [ISC/2020/12524]]. This network is responsible for the promotion of good practice and alignment on diagnostics, testing methods, and use of tests, in order to ensure uniform surveillance, notification and reporting of diseases, as well as strengthened quality of testing and surveillance. 

            

               
(12)
Where in case of cross-border health threats posed by communicable diseases, the blood and transplant services in the Member States can provide a means for rapid testing of the donor population and assessing exposure to and immunity from the disease in the general population. These services are dependent on rapid risk assessments by the Centre to safeguard patients in need of a therapy from a substance of human origin from the transmission of such a communicable disease. 
Such risk assessments serve as the basis for appropriate adaptation of measures setting standards for quality and safety of the substances of human origin.
 The Centre should therefore establish and operate a network of national blood and transplant services and their authorities to serve this purpose. 

            

               
(13)
With the aim of reducing the occurrence of epidemics and strengthening capacities to prevent communicable diseases in the Union, the Centre should develop a framework for the prevention of communicable diseases, which addresses such issues as vaccine preventable diseases, antimicrobial resistance, health education, health literacy and behaviour change. 

            

               
(14)
The Centre should enhance preparedness and response capabilities at national and Union level by providing scientific and technical expertise to the Member States and the Commission. In this context the Centre, in close collaboration with the Member States and the Commission, should carry out various actions, including the development of Union and national preparedness and response plans and preparedness monitoring and evaluation frameworks, provide recommendations on capacities to prevent, prepare and respond to disease outbreaks and on the strengthening of national health systems. The Centre should broaden its collection and analysis of data in terms of epidemiological surveillance and related special health issues, progression of epidemic situations, unusual epidemic phenomena or new diseases of unknown origin, including in third countries, molecular pathogen data and health systems data. To this end, the Centre should ensure appropriate datasets as well as the procedures to facilitate consultation and data transmission and access, carry out scientific and technical evaluation of prevention and control measures at Union level and work with agencies, competent bodies and organisations operating in the field of data collection. 

            

               
(15)
Regulation …/… [
OJ: please, insert reference to Regulation SCBTH
 [ISC/2020/12524]] provides for the
 
early warning and response system enabling the notification at Union level of alerts related to serious cross-border threats to health which continues to be operated by the ECDC. Given that modern technologies can be of substantial support to combat health threats and 
to contain and reverse epidemics
, the ECDC should work on updating this system to enable the use of artificial intelligence technologies and interoperable and privacy-preserving digital tools, such as mobile applications, with tracing functionalities identifying at-risk individuals.

            

               
(16)
The Centre should establish appropriate capacities to support international and field response, in accordance with Regulation …/… [
OJ: please, insert reference to Regulation SCBTH
 [ISC/2020/12524]]. These capacities should enable the Centre to mobilise and deploy outbreak assistance teams, known as ‘EU 
Health Task Force’,
 to assist local responses to outbreaks of diseases. The Centre should therefore ensure capacity to carry out missions to Member States as well as in third countries and to provide recommendations on response to health threats. These teams will also be able to be deployed under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism with the support of the Emergency Response Coordination Centre. The Centre should also support 
the strengthening of preparedness capacities under the International Health Regulations (IHR) in 
third countries,
 in order to address serious cross border threats to health and the consequences thereof.

            

               
(17)
To assist responses to outbreaks, which may spread within or to the Union, the Centre is to develop a framework for the mobilisation the EU Health Task Force in accordance with Decision No 1313/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council

                  

               
 and facilitate the participation of Union field response experts in international response teams in support of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. The Centre should enhance the capability of its staff as well as experts from Union and EEA countries, candidate countries and potential candidates, as well as European Neighbourhood Policy countries and EU partner countries as referred to in Regulation (EU) No 233/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council

                  

               
, to effectively participate in field missions and crisis management.

            

               
(18)
In order to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the legal provisions applicable to the Centre, it is appropriate to provide for a regular Commission evaluation of the performance of the Centre. 

            

               
(19)
This Regulation should not confer any regulatory powers on the Centre.

            

               
(20)
The Centre should implement an information system capable of exchanging classified and sensitive non-classified information to ensure that such information is managed with the utmost discretion.

            

               
(21)
In view of the urgency entailed by the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is considered to be appropriate to provide for an exception to the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.

            

               
(22)
Since the objectives of this Regulation to expand the mission and tasks of the Centre in order to enhance the Centre’s capacity to provide the required scientific expertise and to support actions which combat serious cross-border threats to health in the Union cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the
 
cross-border nature of the health threats and the need for rapid, coordinated and coherent response, be achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

Specify the indicators for monitoring progress and achievements.

            

                  
Detailed objectives and expected results including performance indicators will be established by the annual work programme, while the multi-annual work programme will set out overall strategic objectives, expected results and performance indicators. 

               

                  
For the specific tasks and actions presented in the current proposal, the following indicators are put forward:

               

                  
- Number of risk assessments in a pro-active manner if and when needed or upon request by the European Commission or the Health Security Committee within 1-5 days, depending on the size of the outbreak or other health security incident. 

               

                  
- Number of training modules for preparedness being created.

               

                  
- Percentage of increase of TESSy capacity and up-scaling of EWRS while preserving its rapidity in exchange of information.

               

                  
- Number of rapid, targeted interventions by the EU Health Task Force.

               

               
1.5.
Grounds for the proposal/initiative
 

            

               
1.5.1.
Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative

            

                  
One of the lessons learnt in the COVID-19 pandemic is that the health security framework of the EU needs strengthening for a better EU coordination of preparedness and responses to serious cross-border health threats. The ECDC is a key player in this framework and needs to be strengthened in a targeted manner to carry out an increased array of actions.

               

                  
The mandate revision should take place in early 2021 and be implemented immediately.

               

               
1.5.2.
Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.

            

                  
Reasons for action at European level (ex-ante): the ECDC is an established EU decentralised Agency and its support to Member States and scientific publications are key elements for preparedness response for cross-border health threats. Based on lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic, a mandate revision is timely to enhance the preparedness work in the European Union. 

               

                  
Expected generated Union added value (ex-post) – Member States will be better prepared to confront possible future pandemics and other cross-border health threats.

               

               
1.5.3.
Lessons learnt from similar experiences in the past

            

                  
While the Covid-19 pandemic is still ongoing, this proposal builds on the lessons learnt from the past months of this pandemic. In particular, better preparedness and monitoring is needed.

               

                  
Experience with past revisions of mandates of other EU decentralised agencies was taken into account e.g. EFSA.

               

               
1.5.4.
Compatibility with the Multiannual Financial Framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments

            

                  
The Agency should cooperate and promote synergies with other Union bodies and agencies, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Environment Agency (EEA) and take full advantage and ensure consistency with the EU4Health programme and other EU programmes financing actions in the domain of public health.

MANAGEMENT MEASURES
 

            

               
2.1.
Monitoring and reporting rules
 

            

               
Specify frequency and conditions.

            

                  
All Union agencies work under a strict monitoring system involving an internal control coordinator, the Internal Audit Service of the Commission, the Management Board, the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Budgetary Authority. This system is reflected and laid down in the ECDC’s founding regulation. 

               

                  
In accordance with the Joint Statement on the EU decentralised agencies (the ‘common approach’) and the framework financial regulation (2019/715), the annual work programme of the Agency shall comprise detailed objectives and expected results including set up performance indicators. The Agency will accompany its activities included in its working programme by key performance indicators. The activities of the Agency will then be measured against these indicators in the Consolidated Annual Activity Report. The annual work programme shall be coherent with the multi-annual work programme and both shall be included in an annual single programming document which shall be submitted to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. 

               

                  
The Management Board of the Agency is responsible for the supervision of the administrative, operational and budgetary efficient management of the Agency 

               

                  
Every five years (next evaluation to cover 2018-2022) the Commission shall assess the Agency's performance in relation to its objectives, mandate and tasks. The evaluation shall, in particular, address the possible need to modify the mandate of the Agency, and the financial implications of any such modification. The Commission shall report to the European Parliament, the Council and the Management Board on the evaluation findings. The findings of the evaluation shall be made public.

               

               
2.2.
Management and control system(s)
 

            

               
2.2.1.
Justification of the management mode(s), the funding implementation mechanism(s), the payment modalities and the control strategy proposed

            

                  
The annual EU subsidy is transferred to the Agency in accordance with its payment needs and upon its request. 

               

                  
The Agency will be subject to administrative controls including budgetary control, internal audit, annual reports by the European Court of Auditors, the annual discharge for the execution of the EU budget and possible investigations conducted by OLAF to ensure, in particular, that the resources allocated to agencies are put to proper use. The activities of the Agency will also be subject to the supervision of the Ombudsman in accordance with Article 228 of the Treaty. These administrative controls provide a number of procedural safeguards to ensure that account is taken of the interests of the stakeholders.

               

               
2.2.2.
Information concerning the risks identified and the internal control system(s) set up to mitigate them

            

                  
The main risk relates to under or non implementation of the tasks foreseen. In order to mitigate this, enough resources should be made available in both financial and staffing terms.

               

               
2.3.
Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities
 

            

               
Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures, e.g. from the Anti-Fraud Strategy.

            

                  
Anti-fraud measures are foreseen in Article 25 of the founding regulation of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the Executive Director and the Management Board will take the appropriate measures in accordance with the Internal Control Principles applied across all EU institutions. In line with the Common Approach the anti-fraud strategy has been developed and is applied by the Agency.

               

                  
The mandate of the ECDC clearly states that the provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 shall apply without restriction.

               

                  
The ECDC also accedes to the Inter-institutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) (10) and shall issue, without delay, the appropriate provisions applicable to all of its staff.

               

                  
The ECDC’s decisions concerning funding and the implementing agreements and instruments resulting therefrom shall explicitly stipulate that the Court of Auditors and OLAF may carry out, if necessary, on-the-spot checks of the recipients of the Centre’s funding and the agents responsible for allocating it.

               

                  
In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) may investigate and prosecute fraud and other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/1371.

               

                  
If the ECDC concludes working arrangements with third countries and with international organisations, grant agreements, grant decisions and contracts, these shall contain provisions expressly empowering the Court of Auditors, OLAF and EPPO to conduct such audits and investigations, in accordance with their respective competences.

ESTIMATED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL/INITIATIVE
 

            

               
Given the on-going reflection on the creation of an EU BARDA, the Commission retains the right to adjust the proposed resources and staff allocation when a precise proposal for a EU BARDA is tabled.
