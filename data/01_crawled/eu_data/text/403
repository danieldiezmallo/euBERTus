of 20 July 2020
amending Decision (CFSP) 2017/2370 in support of the Hague Code of Conduct and ballistic missile non-proliferation in the framework of the implementation of the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Articles 28(1) and 31(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,
Whereas:
(1)
On 18 December 2017, the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2017/2370 
1
.
(2)
The grant agreement with the 
Fondation pour la recherche stratégique
 (FRS) was signed on 21 December 2017 and expires on 20 December 2020.
(3)
On 26 May 2020, the FRS requested an extension of the implementation period for Decision (CFSP) 2017/2370 until 20 December 2021. The requested extension is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular the postponement of a number of the activities referred to in Article 1 of that Decision and the reluctance of national administrations in target countries to discuss the organisation of such activities given the climate of uncertainty due to that pandemic.
(4)
The continuation of the activities referred to in Article 1 of Decision (CFSP) 2017/2370 does not have any implication as regards financial resources until 20 December 2021.
(5)
Decision (CFSP) 2017/2370 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
Article 5(2) of Decision (CFSP) 2017/2370 is hereby replaced by the following:
‘2.   This Decision shall expire on 20 December 2021.’.
Article 2
This Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption.
Done at Brussels, 20 July 2020.

                  
For the Council

               

                  
The President
