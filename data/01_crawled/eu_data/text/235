EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

            

               
1.
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

            

               
The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a widespread and severe public health crisis. It severely affects citizens, societies and economies worldwide. The extent of the health crisis and the policy responses taken to control it are unprecedented. As a result, the depth of its socio-economic impact is extraordinarily uncertain. Already at this stage, it is certain that it presents unprecedented and acute challenges for the financial and economic systems of Member States. According to the Commission’s spring economic forecasts

                  

               
, the EU GDP is forecast to contract by about 7.5 % this year - far deeper than during the global financial crisis in 2009 - and to rebound by only 6% in 2021.

            

               
In response, Member States have adopted exceptional discretionary economic and financial measures. Together with the effect of so-called “automatic stabilizers”, i.e. payments foreseen under unemployment insurance and social security systems combined with loss in tax revenue, those measures have a considerable bearing on their public finances with aggregate general government deficit surging from 0.6% of GDP in 2019 to 8.5% of GDP in both the euro area and the EU this year. 

            

               
The COVID-19 pandemic crisis is having a major impact also on societies all around the globe, starting with health systems, and moving to severe global social and economic consequences. Our response strategy needs to be comprehensive, coherent and integrated, tackling both the public health and the socio-economic challenges. The least developed countries are the most vulnerable to COVID-19, given their weak, non-resilient health systems and complex socio-economic and governance challenges. It is already evident that COVID-19 will have a major impact on the economic and macroeconomic systems in our partner countries. Governments will be challenged to sustain macro-economic stability and maintain fiscal space to protect the most vulnerable, their companies, their workers, and continue providing basic social services.

            

               
This exceptional situation calls for a coherent and unified approach at the level of the Union. 

            

               
A comprehensive plan for European recovery will need massive public and private investment at European level to energise the economy, create high-quality jobs and invest in repairing the immediate damage wrought by the Coronavirus. The Commission is therefore proposing to harness the full power of the EU budget to mobilise investment and frontload financial support in the crucial first years of recovery based on:

            

               
A European Union Recovery Instrument as an exceptional measure based on

            

               
Article 122 of TFEU, the financing of which will be based on an empowerment provided in the proposal for the Own Resources Decision.  The funds will enable implementation of fast-acting measures to protect livelihoods, increase prevention and strengthen resilience and recovery in response to the crisis.

            

               
·
A reinforced Multi-Annual Financial Framework for 2021-2027

            

               
The recovery and resilience measures under the European Recovery Instrument will be carried out through the already existing implementation vehicles under a number of specific Union programmes proposed by the Commission under the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027, including:

            

               
–
the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation and its implementing Specific Programme Horizon Europe, 

            

               
–
the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument

            

               
–
the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development

            

                  
It is therefore necessary to amend the Commission proposals related to the above Union programmes.

Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed timeline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative

            

                  
These targeted amendments of Horizon Europe – the Framework, the Specific Programme for Research and Innovation and the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) and of the EAFRD interventions under the CAP Strategic Plans are proposed within the framework of the revised MFF proposal including the European Union Recovery Instrument (EURI). This new instrument will provide funds to these programmes for a limited period of time above the ceilings set for commitment and payment appropriations by the MFF, as external assigned revenue under the meaning of Article 21 of the Financial Regulation. 

               

                  
As a general rule, the financial support and the relevant actions carried out by the Commission should be frontloaded by the end of 2024 and, as regards the non-repayable financial support, for at least 60 percent of the total, be undertaken by the end of 2022. The remaining years after 2024 until the end of the MFF should therefore be used by the Commission to foster the implementation of the relevant actions on the ground and to achieve the expected recovery in the relevant economic and social sectors and promoting resilience and convergence.

               

               
Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point 'added value of Union involvement' is the value resulting from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.

            

                  
(1)

                     
   
In order to contain the spread of the Coronavirus disease (‘COVID-19’), which on 11 March 2020 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation, Member States and third countries have adopted a set of unprecedented measures. Those measures have caused significant disturbances of economic activities. In particular, those measures have disrupted supply chains and production and have caused absences from the workplace. More broadly, those measures have already led to or will lead to severe deterioration of the financial situation of many businesses in the Union and in third countries. 

               

                  
(2)

                     
   
The crisis has spread quickly in the territory of the Union and in third countries. A sharp contraction of growth in the Union is now foreseen for 2020 and may last into 2021. Recovery risks being very uneven in the different Member States, increasing the divergence between national economies. The different fiscal ability of Member States to provide financial support where it is needed most for recovery and the divergence of national measures endangers the single market.

               

                  
(3)

                     
   
A comprehensive set of measures for economic recovery are needed, requiring substantial amounts of public and private investment to energise the economy, create high-quality jobs and invest in repairing the immediate damage brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.

               

                  
(4)

                     
   
This exceptional situation calls for a coherent and unified approach at the level of the Union to prevent further deterioration of the economy and to boost a balanced recovery of the economic activity, ensuiring continuity and increase in investments for the green and digitial transistion. In this context, it is therefore necessary to establish an EU Recovery Instrument to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic or the immediate funding needs to avoid its re-emergence. 

               

                  
(5) Under this logic, the instrument should reinforce the support, via Horizon Europe, to health and climate related research and innovation activities. This will contribute to strengthened preparedness to effectively and rapidly respond to emergencies and investment in science-driven solutions as well as ensuring consistency with the European Green Deal goals.

               

                  
(6) Trade and economic relations with neighbouring and developing countries, including Western Balkans, countries of the European Neighbourhood and African countries, are of high relevance for the economy in the Union. For that reason, and in line with the global role and responsibility of the Union as well as its values, financial resources from the Recovery Instrument via NDICI should also be used to provide support for the efforts of those countries to fight the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and recover from it.

               

                  
(7) The instrument should also reinforce support, through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), making available for Member States exceptional additional resources to provide assistance to the farming and food sectors that have been hardly hit, for fostering crisis repair in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak  and preparing the recovery of the economy.

               

               
Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past

            

                  
For external relations, the Mid-term review report of the External Financing Instrument

                     

                  
 concludes that in the current context of multiple crises and conflicts, the EU’s multi-annual financial framework needs to be able to adjust swiftly to changing priorities and unforeseen events, and to deliver rapidly on the ground. The instruments similarly need sufficient financial and other kinds of flexibility for external action to respond to the many challenges for the EU on the world stage. This flexibility needs to be built up at different levels. This means starting from the budget, which should include more substantial reserves, through to multi-annual programming, and greater simplification at implementation level to increase efficiency and effectiveness. This proposal responds to this conclusion by increasing the availability of additional resources to tackle the unforseen crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

               

                  
Research and Innovation, and in particular the European flagship programme Horizon Europe, delivers on citizens’ priorities, boosts the Union’s productivity and competetiveness, is crucial for sustaining our socio-economic model and values and enabling solutions that address challenges in a more systemic way. Under the current extraordinary circumstances, Europe needs quick R&I-driven solutions and deeper scientific understanding of communicable diseases. The reinforcement would allow for strong R&I investments into affordable and innovative protective measures, virology, vaccines, treatments and diagnostics, and the translation of research findings into public health policy measures. It is essential to devote more resources to climate R&I in support of the competitiveness of EU industry in related economic sectors and to ensure a recovery consistent with the EGD goals. R&I investments can help tackle dramatic increases in emissions and nature degradation with high impact on health (e.g. zoonotic diseases). The reinforcement would support firms that perform R&I to phase out fossil fuels and invest in disruptive technologies in EGD areas. It would provide financial and scale up means for emerging and breakthrough innovations by SMEs, start-ups, and midcaps.The proposal complements other specific measures already taken providing relief to the agricultural sector. Regulatory measures were taken, such as adaptation of state aid rules or facilitating the availability of seasonal workers.

               

                  
The Commission has also adapted the rules and introduced changes to the two dedicated agricultural funds, the EAGF and the EAFRD to provide exceptional flexibility for the use of the European Structural and Investments Funds in response to the COVID-19 outbreak (Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative) as well as all other measures aimed at addressing the current unprecedented situation. The measures are consistent with the Commission’s proposal for a European Union Recovery Instrument set out by the proposed Regulation (EU) XXX/XX.

               

               
Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments

            

                  
On top of the synergies already listed for Horizon Europe, NDICI and the EAFRD interventions under the CAP Strategic Plans in the previous Commission 2018 respective proposals, this specific initiative in the context of the revised MFF proposal sets strong synergies between these programmes and the new European Union Recovery Instrument, set out by the proposed Regulation (EU) XXX/XX. The latter will allow to provide funds to these sectorial programmes for a limited period of time above the ceilings of the MFF as a result of the complementarity of objectivities and functioning of these instruments and in light of rationale and added value presented in the section 1.4.2. above.

The appropriations required for human resources and other expenditure of an administrative nature will be met by appropriations from the DG that are already assigned to management of the action and/or have been redeployed within the DG, together if necessary with any additional allocation which may be granted to the managing DG under the annual allocation procedure and in the light of budgetary constraints. Additional staff will be only external staff and will be financed solely from assigned revenues.
