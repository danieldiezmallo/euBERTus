1.   
Conclusions and recommendations

      
1.1.
The EESC welcomes the proposal for a regulation, which it deems to be an appropriate and proportionate reaction to the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
1.2.
The proposal fulfils the dual objective of ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market while providing for a high level of public safety and environmental protection.
2.   
Gist of the Commission proposal

      
2.1.
Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
1
 sets out new emissions limits (‘Stage V’), which are designed to reduce the emissions of air pollutants from engines for non-road mobile machinery (NRMM), and provides some lead time to make this transition.
2.2.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been causing major disruption of the supply chain, with an impact on the ability of NRMM manufacturers to meet some of the deadlines imposed by the regulation.
2.3.
The proposal aims to postpone by 12 months the dates for producing and marketing NRMM and tractors fitted with transition engines, thereby helping manufacturers to face a disruption that could not have been foreseen.
3.   
General comments

      
3.1.
The EESC reiterates its belief that reducing harmful emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and particulates from engines intended for agricultural and forestry tractors is a vital step towards achieving the EU’s air quality targets.
3.2.
In its opinion 
2
 on Regulation (EU) 2016/1628, the EESC recommended rapid approval of the new regulation in view of the strong public health concerns about nanoparticles resulting from combustion processes and the high level of protection that can be achieved by implementing the proposed Stage V for NRMM engines.
3.3.
The EESC is nevertheless well aware that the COVID-19 crisis has created extraordinary circumstances which have an impact on various areas. The crisis has caused complete interruptions in the supply of parts and components, leaving manufacturers with stocks of engines and unfinished products.
3.4.
As a consequence, many engine and machinery manufacturers will not be able to meet the deadlines set out by the regulation without suffering serious economic damage.
3.5.
In addition, the EESC is fully aware that the crisis was not, and could not have been, foreseen.
3.6.
The EESC therefore supports the extension of one year provided by the proposal, which in its view is a reasonable and proportionate measure aimed at guaranteeing the smooth functioning of the internal market as well as a high level of public safety and environmental protection.
