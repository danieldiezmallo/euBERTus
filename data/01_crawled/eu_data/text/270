Having regard to the proposal from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,

(1)
On 21 December 2016 the Council adopted Decision (CFSP) 2016/2383

, which provides for a 36-month implementation period from the date of conclusion of the financing agreement referred to in that Decision, for the activities referred to in Article 1 thereof.

The continuation of the activities referred to in Article 1 of Decision (CFSP) 2016/2383 can be performed without any financial resource implication until 14 December 2020.
(5)
