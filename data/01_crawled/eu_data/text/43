introduction

            

               
The regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework (MFF regulation) for the years 2014-2020 as last amended by Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 2017/1123 of 20 June 2017

                  

               
 and adjusted as shown in the communication on the technical adjustment for 2020

                  

               
 contains the financial framework table for the period 2014-2020, expressed in 2011 prices (Table 1). 

            

               
According to Article 6(1) of the MFF regulation, the Commission makes each year, ahead of the budgetary procedure for year n+1, a technical adjustment to the multiannual financial framework (MFF) in line with movements in the EU's gross national income (GNI) and prices and communicates the results to the Council and the European Parliament. The adjustment of the ceilings in line with Article 6(1) was done in the technical adjustment for 2020 in May 2019 and based on Article 6(4) it is not being updated. 

            

               
The Communication on the technical adjustment for 2020 has indicated the availability of the special instruments for the years 2019 and 2020 according to Article 6(1)(e) and (f) of the MFF Regulation for the availability of the Global margin for commitments and Flexibility instrument respectively as known in spring 2019. The purpose of this communication is to present to the Council and the European Parliament the additional availabilities of the special instruments according to Article 6(1)(e) and (f) of the MFF Regulation for the the Global margin for commitments and Flexibility instrument respectively for the year 2020, which became available at the end of 2019. 

            

               
The communication also shows the available amounts of all special instruments and their use since 2014 for information.

Global Margin for Payments
 (GMP)

            

               
According to Article 5 of the MFF Regulation, the Commission shall adjust the payment ceiling for the years 2015-2020 upwards by an amount equivalent to the difference between the executed payments and the MFF payment ceiling of the year n-1. Any upward adjustment shall be fully offset by a corresponding reduction of the payment ceiling for year n-1 in constant 2011 prices.

            

               
No recalculation of the GMP is done for 2020 as the threshold set by Article 5(2) of the MFF Regulation has been reached in the technical adjustment for 2020 adopted in May 2019.

Special Instruments

These instruments aim to provide rapid response to exceptional or unforeseen events, and provide some flexibility beyond the agreed expenditure ceilings within certain limits.

Global margin for commitments
 for growth and employment, in particular youth employment, and for migration and security measures (GMC)

            

               
According to Article 14 of the MFF Regulation, as amended by Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 2017/1123, margins left available below the MFF ceilings for commitment appropriations shall constitute a Global MFF Margin for commitments, to be made available over and above the ceilings established in the MFF for the years 2016 to 2020 for policy objectives related to growth and employment, in particular youth employment, and to migration and security.

            

               
In the final budget 2019 the margin left available under the commitment ceiling amounts to EUR 1 291,1 million. The commitments on Special instruments (including the use of GMC and the Contingency margin) are not taken into account as they are implemented over and above the MFF ceilings.

            

               
According to Article 6(2) of the MFF Regulation, the 2% annual deflator shall be used for the calculation of the GMC. The amount of the remaining margin from 2019 which shall be made available for 2020 corresponds to EUR 1 316,9 million in current prices. The amount of GMC in 2011 prices corresponds to EUR 1 101,9 million.
