THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on the interoperability of the rail system within the European Union 
1
, and in particular Article 21(9) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Directive (EU) 2016/797 was amended by Directive (EU) 2020/700 
2
 in order to give Member States the possibility to extend the deadline to bring into force the national laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the provisions referred to in Article 57(1) Directive (EU) 2016/797.
(2)
The assessment of applications for a vehicle type authorisation or a vehicle authorisation for placing on the market in accordance with Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
3
, for which the relevant authorisations had to be issued before 16 June 2020, might be delayed because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, in the Member States that have notified the Agency and the Commission in accordance with Article 57(2) of Directive (EU) 2016/797 and where Directive (EU) 2016/797 is to apply from 16 June 2020, the national safety authority (‘NSA’) should, at the request of the applicant, continue the assessment beyond that date. The NSA should finalise that assessment and issue the authorisation before 30 October 2020.
(3)
With regard to Member States that have notified the European Union Agency for Railways (‘the Agency’) and the Commission of their intention to extend the transposition period of Directive (EU) 2016/797 in accordance with Article 57(2a) thereof, the application of certain provisions of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/545 
4
 should be postponed and apply from 31 October 2020. Transitional provisions set out in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/545 should also be adapted.
(4)
Applicants may have compiled applications in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/545 in view to the current application deadline. For the purposes of both Directive 2008/57/EC and Directive (EU) 2016/797, vehicles are to comply with technical specifications for interoperability and relevant national rules and meet the essential requirements. Applications drawn up in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/545 should include all the necessary evidence for either the placing in service of vehicles under Directive 2008/57/EC or the placing on the market of vehicles under Directive (EU) 2016/797. Therefore, applicants should be allowed to submit, to national safety authorities in Member States that have notified the Agency and the Commission in accordance with Article 57(2a) of Directive (EU) 2016/797, applications which list evidence in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/545. National safety authorities should accept those applications without requiring a revised application.
(5)
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/545 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(6)
The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 51(1) of Directive (EU) 2016/797.
(7)
In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the
