Proposal for a
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
amending Regulation (EU) 2017/1601 establishing the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), the EFSD Guarantee and the EFSD Guarantee Fund

            

               
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

            

               
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

            

                  
The Coronavirus disease outbreak (‘COVID-19’) has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. Since then, countries across the world have adopted extraordinary measures to respond to and contain the outbreak.

               

                  
As a result of the pandemic, a sharp contraction of growth is predicted. The measures taken by the Member States and partner countries in response to the crisis have severely disrupted supply chains and production and have caused absences from the workplace. In addition, the provision of many services has become impossible or very difficult. At the same time, consumer demand has dropped. The measures have already led to or will lead to severe deterioration of the financial situation of many businesses.

               

                  
The COVID-19 pandemic crisis is having a major impact on societies around the globe, starting with health systems, and moving to severe global social and economic consequences. The response strategy of the Union should be comprehensive, coherent and integrated, tackling both the public health and the socio-economic challenges. The least developed countries are the most vulnerable to COVID-19, given their weak, non-resilient health systems and complex socio-economic and governance challenges. It is already evident that COVID-19 will have a major impact on the economic and macroeconomic systems in our partner countries. Governments will be challenged to sustain macro-economic stability and maintain fiscal space to protect the most vulnerable, their companies, their workers, and continue providing basic social services.

               

                  
This exceptional situation calls for a coherent and unified approach at the level of the Union, valid for both the internal and external dimension. To prevent further deterioration of the economy and to boost a balanced, unified and equal recovery of the economic activity, an exceptional and coordinated programme of economic support should be put in place. Therefore, substantial amounts of public and private investment are needed to find innovative solutions, energise the economy, create high-quality jobs and invest in repairing the immediate damage brought by the COVID-19 outbreak. 

               

                  
In view of that the Commission proposes an ambitious package including an increase in the ceilings under the 2014-2020 Multi-annual Financial Framework to enable the implementation of measures within the Union and beyond in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as measures supporting affected businesses, cohesion support to Member States, capacity building to enhance future crisis preparedness and other relevant policy areas and related measures. 

               

                  
It is proposed that those measures are carried out under specific Union instruments and programmes and in accordance with the relevant Union acts laying down rules for those instruments and programmes. 

               

                  
It is therefore necessary to enable the implementation of those measures through the delivery mechanisms under Regulation (EU) 2017/1601 establishing the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), the EFSD Guarantee and the EFSD Guarantee Fund.

BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

            

                  
The Union will make available an additional amount of EUR 1 040 million  for the European Fund for Sustainable Development, increasing the EU guarantee by EUR 2 078 million and bringing the total Union guarantee ceiling to EUR 3 578 million. 

               

                  
This proposal prolongs until 31 December 2021 the investment period during which the EFSD guarantee agreements for supporting financing and investment operations can be concluded with the eligible counterparts.

Detailed explanation of the specific provisions of the proposal

            

                  
The legal framework consists of targeted modifications to the Regulation (EU) 2017/1601 establishing the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), the EFSD Guarantee and the EFSD Guarantee Fund.

               

                  
The main amendments introduced aim at: 

               

               
–
Extending the geographic scope of the EFSD to the beneficiaries in the Western Balkans listed in Annex I of Regulation 231/2014

                  

               
 .

            

               
–
Increasing the contribution to the European Fund for Sustainable De
velopment from the Union budget in view of implementing operations in response of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            

               
–
Prolonging the 
investment period during which the EFSD guarantee agreements for supporting financing and investment operations can be con
cluded with the eligible counterparts.

            

               
2020/0107 (COD)

            

               
Proposal for a

            

               
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

            

               
amending Regulation (EU) 2017/1601 establishing the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), the EFSD Guarantee and the EFSD Guarantee Fund

               

            

               
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

            

               
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 209(1) and 212(2) thereof,

            

               
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

            

               
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

            

               
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

            

               
Whereas:

            

               
(1)
The COVID-19 pandemic crisis is ha
ving a major impact on societies around the globe, starting with health systems, and moving to severe global social and economic consequences. The response strategy of the Union should be comprehensive, coherent and integrated, tackling both the public hea
lth and the socio-economic challenges both within the Union as well as in cooperation with its partner countries, notably in Africa, in the European Neighbourhood and with the beneficiaries in the Western Balkans listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 231
/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council

                  

               
. The COVID-19 pandemic will have a major impact on the economic and macroeconomic systems in partner countries. Governments will be challenged to sustain macro-economic stability and maintain fiscal spac
e to protect the most vulnerable, their companies, their workers, and continue providing basic health care and social services. It is expected in particular that small and medium sized enterprises will run short of liquidity and working capital, putting mi
llions of jobs at risk. Local currency financing is likely to become even more difficult to obtain, while depreciating currencies make hard currency financing even riskier. Similar issues will affect renewable energy and other infrastructure projects finan
ced by fee income.

            

               
(2)
In addition to the necessary measures and their consequences that third countries need to take to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, the socio-economic situation in the Western Balkans will be further aggravated by the challenges the Unio
n itself is facing due to the proximity and interdependency of those countries with the Union economy and their economic and social links with the Union. Therefore, the coverage of the European Fund for Sustainable Development should be extended to the Wes
tern Balkans with a view to assist them in a sustainable socio-economic recovery and resilience, re-establishing supply chains and sustaining macro-economic stability.

            

               
(3)
The Commission has at its disposal a powerful tool for mitigating investment risks, 
the European Fund for Sustainable Development (‘EFSD’), the financing arm of the External Investment Plan launched in 2017. That instrument, currently covering the European Neighbourhood and Sub-Saharan Africa, is implemented in partnership with internatio
nal financial institutions and development and finance institutions of the Member States. Globally, the EFSD is one of the largest public guarantee programmes in support of private sector investment for development. 

            

               
(4)
Article 137(2) of the Agreement on 
the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community provides that the United Kingdom and projects located in the United Kingdom shall only be eligible in respect of fin
ancial operations guaranteed by the Union budget under the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD) provided that those financial operations were approved by the entities and bodies, including the EIB and the European Investment Fund (‘EIF’), or by
 persons entrusted with the implementation of part of those actions before the date of entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement. Furthermore, Article 143(1) of the Withdrawal Agreement limits the liability of the United Kingdom for its share of the con
tingent liabilities of the Union to those contingent liabilities, which arise from financial operations decided by the Union before the date of the entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement. Any contingent liability of the Union under this Regulation is
 subsequent to the date of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union. Therefore, this Regulation should not apply to and in the United Kingdom.

.

               

               
1.5.
Grounds for the proposal/initiative
 

            

               
1.5.1.
Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term including a detailed ti
meline for roll-out of the implementation of the initiative

            

                  
The investment period during which the EFSD guarantee agreements for supporting financing and investment operations can be concluded with the eligible counterparts shall last until 31 December 2021.

               

               
1.5.2.
Added value of Union involvement (it may result from different factors, e.g. coordination gains, legal certainty, greater effectiveness or complementarities). For the purposes of this point ‘added value of Union involvement’ is the value resultin
g from Union intervention which is additional to the value that would have been otherwise created by Member States alone.

            

                  
The present amendment of the EFSD Regulation is proposed within the framework of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences. Providing additional funds to the EFSD under the current MFF, thereby increasing its capacity to grant guarantees in partner countries, facilitates a swift reply to the Covid-19 pandemic in these regions. 

               

                  
This is in line with the global role, responsibility and values of the Union.

               

               
1.5.3.
Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past

            

               
The entire amount of the initial EFSD guarantee envelope (EUR 1.54 bn including contributions from third parties) has been allocated to 28 guarantees. These are expected to leverage EUR 17.5 bn in investments. The existing pipeline and discussions with partner financial institutions confirm that the EFSD has the potential to more than double its signed guarantee operations until the end of 2021.

            

               
1.5.4.
Compatibili
ty with the Multiannual Financial Framework and possible synergies with other appropriate instruments

            

                  
The additional guarantee amount is financed within the limits of the Commission proposal for a raised ceiling of the current MFF.

               

               
1.5.5.
Assessment of the
 different available financing options, including scope for redeployment

            

                  
There are no further possibilities of redeployment or use of margins or special instrument in the current MFF. The additional guarantee amount is therefore financed within the limits of the Commission proposal for a raised ceiling of the current MFF.
