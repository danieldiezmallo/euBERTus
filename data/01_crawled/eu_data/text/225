Proposal for a
COUNCIL REGULATION
establishing a European Union Recovery Instrument to support the recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic

               
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

            

               
1.
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

            

               
•
Reasons for and objectives of the proposal

            

               
The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a widespread and severe public health crisis. It severely affects citizens, societies and economies worldwide. The extent of the health crisis and the policy responses taken to control it are unprecedented. As a result, the depth of its socio-economic impact is extraordinarily uncertain. Already at this stage, it is certain that it presents unprecedented and acute challenges for the financial and economic systems of Member States. According to the Commission’s spring economic forecasts

                  

               
, the EU GDP is forecast to contract by about 7.5 % this year - far deeper than during the global financial crisis in 2009 - and to rebound by only 6% in 2021,
 while the EU unemployment rate is set to rise to 9% in 2020, with a risk of rising poverty and inequality
.

            

               
In response, Member States have adopted exceptional discretionary economic and financial measures. Together with the effect of so-called “automatic stabilizers”, i.e. payments foreseen under unemployment insurance and social security systems combined with loss in tax revenue, those measures have a considerable bearing on their public finances with aggregate general government deficit surging from 0.6% of GDP in 2019 to 8.5% of GDP in both the euro area and the EU this year. 

            

               
The shock to the EU economy is symmetric in that the pandemic has hit all Member States, however, the impact of the pandemic differs considerably between Member States, as does their ability to absorb the economic and fiscal shock and respond to it, depending on the specific economic structures and initial conditions of the Member States. As a result, there is a risk that the crisis will widen disparities within the Union threatening the collective economic and social resilience. 

            

               
The Union has acted rapidly to deliver a coordinated and powerful collective response to the social and economic consequences of the crisis, within the limits of the current Multiannual Financial Framework expiring in 2020. That response complements discretionary economic and financial measures taken by Member States.

            

               
The crisis could result in lasting damage to the Union’s economic tissue unless it is met with a commensurate short and medium term policy response at the level of the Union. 

            

               
A comprehensive plan for European recovery will need massive public and private investment at European level to set the Union firmly on the path to a sustainable and resilient recovery, creating high-quality jobs and and repairing
 
the immediate damage brought by the COVID-19 pandemic whilst supporting the Union’s green and digital priorities. To provide the financing for the proposed act, the Commission proposes an amendment to the [ORD] which would authorise the Union to borrow temporarily and exceptionally an amount of EUR 750 billion in 2018 prices, to increase the own resources ceiling to accommodate the liabilities and contingent liabilities for loans to the Member States. The proposed act determines the allocation of funds to different Union programmes in line with the strategy set out in the European Union Recovery Plan. 

            

               
EUR 500 billion in 2018 prices will be spent for non-repayable support, repayable support through financial instruments or for provisioning for budgetary guarantees and related expenditure. 

            

               
EUR 250 billion in 2018 prices will be used to provide loans to Member States. The Union will bear contingent liability in the form of a guarantee for those loans until they are repaid. 

            

               
Article 3 fixes the maximum amount that can finance the Instrument. The uses to which the funds can be put are also clearly prescribed in Article 3, describing the recipient programmes, as well as the nature of the support (grants, loans and guarantees). In Articles 2 and 4, this Regulation also strictly limits the scope and the time within which the funds can be used. This excludes that the European Union Recovery Instrument can be used for any purpose other than tackling the direct economic and social consequences of this crisis.

            

               
•
Consistency with other Union policies

            

               
The European Union Recovery Instrument provides funding for measures and actions to be carried out as outlined in the European Union Recovery Plan. The resources raised through the issuance will be used for Union´s programmes under the next multi-annual financial framework in 
the following areas
:

            

               
·
Providing support in the form of grants and loans to implement Member State recovery and resilience plans under the Recovery and Resilience Facility;

            

               
·
Providing new investment support under existing and proposed budgetary guarantees (EFSI/InvestEU) for inter alia (1) crisis-impacted but viable companies to emerge from the crisis, in particular to accelerate the twin green and digital transition; (2) targeted support to projects of European strategic interest for internal market supply chains to develop the EU’s strategic autonomy in key sectors and capacities;

            

               
·
Enhanced support to regions and sectors hit by the crisis through reinforced cohesion policy measures;

            

               
·
Supporting research and innovation  in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;

            

               
·
Enhancing the level of crisis preparedness and improving the strategic resilience of Union health care systems; 

            

               
·
Mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the just transition towards a green economy in territories;

            

               
·
Supporting measures to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural development;

            

               
·
Supporting partner countries, in particular in the Western Balkans, the Neighbourhood and Africa, in their efforts to fight and recover from the impact of the pandemic and to strengthen their resilience. 

            

               
The actions and measures will be carried out in accordance with the conditions laid down in the basic acts establishing the policy instruments. This is why the Commission presents in parallel the necessary legislative proposals ensuring that those policy instruments can receive external assigned revenues resulting from the implementation of this Regulation.

LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY

            

               
•
Legal basis

            

               
Article 122 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union foresees the possibility of measures, decided in a spirit of solidarity between Member States, appropriate to the economic situation. The present situation is unprecedented. It is characterized by severe difficulties caused by exceptional occurrences beyond the Member States’ control. Therefore, it is appropriate to adopt under Article 122 TFEU exceptional temporary measures to support recovery and resilience across the Union. 

            

               
•
Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) 

            

               
The objectives pursued by this instrument cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States individually because of the scale of the measures which need to be taken. The European Union Recovery Instrument enables the Union to complement economic and financial measures of Member States, in particular in the form of “automatic stabilizers” and discretionary economic and financial measures, by a rapid and targeted significant increase in discretionary spending. 

            

               
Such complementary mobilisation of funding ensures that the internal market is not undermined by disparities in the ability of Member States to mobilise funding, and provides in a spirit of solidarity funding also in those Member States where fiscal space for discretionary spending is limited. In addition, it ensures that spending is carried out based on a coherent economic strategy coordinated between the Member States.

            

               
Only such a concerted action motivated by a spirit of solidarity between Member States in a time of crisis can ensure that proceeds are mobilised in sufficient resources to generate effective interventions by the Union in the most affected areas or sectors. 

            

               
•
Proportionality

            

                  
The financing from the European Union Recovery Instrument in the volumes required is due to the unprecedented circumstances in which the Union finds itself. The Recovery Instrument is clearly circumscribed in terms of duration and use. This ensures that its use is strictly limited to tackling the impact of this crisis on a scale commensurate to the impact of this crisis. The financing would be geared towards the need to provide immediate and forceful support for an economic recovery. 

               

               
•
Choice of the instrument

            

               
The Commission deems suitable to act by way of Regulation because of its direct and immediate applicability and its general scope.

4.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

            

                  
The proposed Regulation will provide financial support from external assigned revenue from the Union’s borrowing authorised under Article 3b of [ORD] for non-repayable support, repayable support through financial instruments and for provisioning for budgetary guarantees and related expenditure. This entails the need to foresee commitment and payment appropriations to cover amounts falling due for the borrowing (for coupon payments and redemptions at maturity). No repayments from the EU budget are envisaged before 2028. The necessary appropriation to cover potential coupon payments over the period 2021-2027 are compatible with the Commission proposal for the Multiannual Financial Framework, and in particular Heading 2 Cohesion and Values (excluding ‘Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion’). Future Multiannual Financial Frameworks will need to provide the necessary appropriations to cover coupon payments and redemptions at maturity.

               

                  
Loans will be repaid by the beneficiary Member States and the Union will bear only contingent liability compatible with the specific own resources ceiling. 

               

                  
An indicative planning of the expected revenue as well as related expenditure is provided in the Legislative Financial Statement.

OTHER ELEMENTS

            

               
•
Implementation plans and monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements

            

                  
Maximum transparency and proper monitoring of the use of the EU financial resources are required. Reporting obligations for the Member States and the Commission will apply.

Proposal for a

            

               
COUNCIL REGULATION

            

               
establishing a European Union Recovery Instrument to support the recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic

            

               
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

            

               
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 122 thereof,

            

               
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

            

               
Whereas: 

            

               
(1)
In order to contain the spread of the Coronavirus disease (
‘
COVID-19
’
), which on 11 March 2020 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation, Member States have adopted a set of unprecedented measures.

            

               
(2)
Those measures, taken in response to that exceptional situation, which is beyond the control of the Member States, have caused significant disturbances of economic activities reflected in a steep decline in gross domestic product
 and a significant impact on employment, social conditions, poverty and inequalities
. In particular, those measures have disrupted supply chains and production and have caused absences from the workplace. In addition, the provision of many services has become impossible or very difficult. At the same time, consumer demand has dropped. Many businesses experience liquidity shortages, and their solvency is at risk, while the financial markets are very volatile. Key sectors like travel and tourism are particularly hard hit. More broadly, those measures have already led to or will lead to severe deterioration of the financial situation of many businesses in the Union. 

            

               
(3)
The crisis has spread quickly in the territory of the Union and in third countries. A sharp contraction of growth in the Union is foreseen for 2020. Recovery risks being very uneven in the different Member States, increasing the divergence between national economies. The different fiscal ability of Member States to provide financial support where it is needed most for recovery and the divergence of national measures endangers the single market
 as well as social and territorial cohesion
.

            

               
(4)
A comprehensive set of measures for economic recovery are needed, requiring substantial amounts of public and private investment to 
set
 the 
Union firmly on the path to a sustainable and resilient recovery, creating
 high-quality jobs,
 support social inclusion
 and repairing the immediate damage brought by the COVID-19 pandemic 
whilst supporting the Union’s green and digital priorities
. 

            

               
(5)
This exceptional situation, which is beyond the control of the Member States, calls for a coherent and unified approach at the level of the Union. To prevent further deterioration of the economy
 employment and social cohesion
 and to boost a 
sustainable and resilient 
recovery of the economic activity, an exceptional and coordinated programme of economic 
and social 
support should be put in place, in a 
spirit of solidarity between Member States, in particular for those who have been particularly hardly hit.

            

               
(6)
As the Instrument is an exceptional response to these temporary but extreme circumstances, the support under the Instrument should only be made available in order to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic or the immediate funding needs to avoid a re-emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.  

            

               
(7)
This Instrument should in particular focus on measures to restore labour markets,
 social protection
 and health care systems, measures to reinvigorate potential for sustainable growth 
and employment 
in order to strengthen cohesion among Member States and 
support their transition towards a green and digital economy
, to provide support to businesses affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular small and medium sized enterprises and economically viable businesses facing solvency constraints, measures to strengthen the strategic autonomy of the Union in vital supply chains, support for  research and innovation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, capacity building at Union level to enhance future crisis preparedness, support maintaining efforts of territories towards a just transition, and support rural areas in addressing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Trade and economic relations with neighbouring and developing countries, in particular in the Western Balkans, countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy and countries in Africa, are of high relevance for the economy in the Union. For that reason, and in line with the global role and responsibility of the Union, financial resources should also be used to provide support and humanitarian aid for the efforts of those countries to fight the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and recover from it in order to restore and strengthen trade and economic relations between them and the Union. 

            

               
(8)
To ensure a 
sustainable and resilient 
recovery throughout the Union and to facilitate the implementation of economic support, the established mechanisms of spending through Union´s programmes under the relevant multi-annual financial frameworks should be used. Support under those programmes is provided in the form of non-repayable support, loans, and the provisioning of budgetary guarantees. The allocation of financial resources should reflect the extent to which those programmes are capable of contributing to the objectives of the Instrument.

            

               
(9)
In view of the nature of the measures to be funded, one part of the amounts available for this Instrument should be used to provide loans to Member States, whereas the other part of the resources should constitute external assigned revenue in the meaning of Article 21(5) of the Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046
 of the European Parliament and of the Council

                  

               
 and should be used for non-repayable support, financial instruments or provisioning for budgetary guarantees and related expenditure by the Union. While Articles 12(4)(c) and 14(3) of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046
 
apply to commitment and payment appropriations made available in relation to the external assigned revenue under this Regulation, in view of the time limits set for the different types of support, commitment appropriations resulting from such external assigned revenues should not be automatically carried-over beyond the respective end dates
, 
except for commitment appropriations necessary for technical 
and administrative assistance for implementation of the measures under this Regulation
. 

            

               
(10)
Commitment appropriations for non-repayable support should be made available automatically up to the authorised amount. Liquidity should be managed effectively, so that funds are raised only when the legal commitments need to be honoured through corresponding payment appropriations. 

            

               
(11)
Given the importance of using the amounts in the first years of the Instrument, it is appropriate to review progress in the implementation. The Commission should prepare a report to this effect by 31 March 2023. 

            

               
(12)
Article 135(2) of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community

                  

               
 provides that amendments to Council Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom

                  

               
 that are adopted on or after the date of entry into force of that Agreement shall not apply to the United Kingdom insofar as those amendments have an impact on the United Kingdom's financial obligations. The support under this Regulation and the corresponding increase of the own resources ceiling of the Union would have an impact on United Kingdom's financial obligation. Article 143(1) of the Withdrawal Agreement limits the liability of the United Kingdom for its share of the contingent liabilities of the Union to those contingent liabilities which arise from financial operations decided by the Union before the date of the entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement. Any contingent liability of the Union under this Regulation is subsequent to the date of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union. Therefore, this Regulation should not apply to and in the United Kingdom, 

                  

               

            

               
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Objective(s)

            

               
1.4.1.
The Commission's multiannual strategic objective(s) targeted by the proposal/initiative 

            

                  
The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a widespread and severe public health crisis. It severely affects citizens, societies and economies worldwide. The extent of the health crisis and the policy responses taken to control it are unprecedented. As a result, the depth of its socio-economic impact is extraordinarily uncertain. Already at this stage, it is certain that it presents unprecedented and acute challenges for the financial and economic systems of Member States. According to the Commission’s spring economic forecasts

                     

                  
, the EU GDP is forecast to contract by about 7.5 % this year - far deeper than during the global financial crisis in 2009 - and to rebound by only 6% in 2021
,
 while the EU unemployment rate is set to rise to 9% in 2020, with a risk of rising poverty and inequality.

               

                  
In response, Member States have adopted exceptional discretionary economic and financial measures. Together with the effect of so-called “automatic stabilizers”, i.e. payments foreseen under unemployment insurance and social security systems combined with loss in tax revenue, those measures have a considerable bearing on their public finances with aggregate general government deficit surging from 0.6% of GDP in 2019 to 8.5% of GDP in both the euro area and the EU this year. 

               

                  
The crisis could result in lasting damage to the Union’s economic tissue unless it is met with a commensurate short and medium term policy response at the level of the Union. 

               

                  
A comprehensive plan for European recovery will need massive public and private investment at European level to set the Union firmly on the path to a sustainable and resilient recovery, creating high-quality jobs and and repairing
 
the immediate damage brought by the COVID-19 pandemic whilst supporting the Union’s green and digital priorities. The long-term EU budget, as reinforced, will be the main tool. 

               

               
1.4.2.
Specific objective(s) and ABM/ABB activity(ies) concerned

            

                  
The proposed act determines the allocation of the proceeds of the Union’s borrowing, as authorised under the Own Resources Decision, to  the policy  programmes in line with the strategy set out in the European Union Recovery Plan.

               

                  
EUR 500 billion in 2018 prices will be spent for non-repayable support, repayable support through financial instruments or for provisioning for budgetary guarantees and related expenditure. 

               

                  
EUR 250 billion in 2018 prices will be used to provide loans to Member States. The Union will bear contingent liability in the form of a guarantee for those loans until they are repaid.

               

               
Specify the effects which the proposal/initiative should have on the beneficiaries/groups targeted.

            

                  
The proposed act shall attribute the financing for measures and actions to tackle the adverse economic consequences of COVID-19 and support the economic recovery in particular in the following areas: 

               

               
·
Providing support in the form of grants and loans to implement Member State recovery and resilience plans under the Recovery and Resilience Facility;

            

               
·
Providing new investment support under existing and proposed budgetary guarantees (EFSI/InvestEU) for inter alia (1) crisis-impacted but viable companies to emerge from the crisis, in particular to accelerate the twin green and digital transition; (2) targeted support to projects of European strategic interest for internal market supply chains to develop the EU’s strategic autonomy in key sectors and capacities;

            

               
·
Enhanced support to regions and sectors hit by the crisis through reinforced cohesion policy measures;

            

               
·
Supporting research and innovation  in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;

            

               
·
Enhancing the level of crisis preparedness and improving the strategic resilience of Union health care systems; 

            

               
·
Mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the just transition towards a green economy in territories;

            

               
·
Supporting measures to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural development;

            

               
·
Supporting partner countries, in particular in the Western Balkans, the Neighbourhood and Africa, in their efforts to fight and recover from the impact of the pandemic and to strengthen their resilience.

1.5.
Grounds for the proposal/initiative 

            

               
1.5.1.
Requirement(s) to be met in the short or long term 

            

                  
The current proposal for a Council regulation aims at complementing the existing Union instruments and legal basis, providing a mechanism for attributing support to the different policy areas.

               

                  
The operational provisions governing the implementation of this support are contained in the legislative acts defining the beneficiary EU policy instruments, which aim to provide immediate and forceful support for an economic recovery and resilience. 

               

               
1.5.2.
Added value of EU involvement

            

                  
The proposed EU Recovery Instrument is based on Article 122 TFEU. This article foresees the possibility of measures, decided in a spirit of solidarity between Member States, appropriate to the economic situation. 

               

                  
Currently, Member States are facing a severe economic disturbance caused by the COVID-19 virus outbreak which has strong negative socio-economic impacts in Member States.

               

                  
The proposal allocates the financial support, made possible by the temporary and exceptional empowerment contained in the Own Resources Decision, to the crisis-related policy interventions in a spirit of European solidarity with affected Member States. Considering the extent of the crisis and the scope of its financial and economic effects, concerted action at EU level is more appropriate to ensure that sufficient resources are mobilised to generate effective interventions and mitigate the direct societal and economic impact caused by COVID-19 crisis. 

               

                  
The implementation of the European Union Recovery Instrument is underpinned by the subsidiarity principle. In fact, due to the global dimension of the COVID-19 pandemic and of the scope of its financial and economic effects, the Union is better placed than single Member States to address the crisis through targeted EU policies, made possible by a large-scale resources enabled by the exceptional empowerment to borrow to supplement the Union budget, contained in the Own Resources Decision. 

               

                  
The assignment of the additional externally assigned revenues via the proposed act will ensure that the implementation of the envisaged response by the Union is not undermined by disparities in the ability of Member States to mobilise the funding individually. 

               

                  
Only a concerted action motivated by a spirit of solidarity between Member States in a time of crisis can ensure that the relevant financial means are deployed effectively to generate effective interventions by the Union in the most affected areas or sectors. 

               

               
1.5.3.
Lessons learned from similar experiences in the past

            

                  
When the Union was confronted with a grave financial crisis a decade ago, the legal basis of Article 122 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) enabled the Union to provide financial assistance from the Union to Member States faced with difficulties caused by an exceptional event beyond their control. The Union adopted on the basis of Article 122(2) Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 of the Council of 11 May 2010 establishing a European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM). This instrument provided Union financial assistance to Portugal, Ireland and a bridge financing to Greece by means of back-to-back-loans. 

               

                  
The legal basis of Article 122 TFEU has been used as the legal basis for the recent Commission proposal for the SURE mechanism to support Member State temporary unemployment insurance schemes. This legal basis is deemed appropriate for an exceptional occurrence beyond Member States’ control which calls for a collective Union resposne in a spirit of solidarity, and can  therefore also be used in this particular crisis event of the COVID-19 virus outbreak. 

               

               
1.5.4.
Compatibility and possible synergy with other appropriate instruments

            

                  
The proposed European Union Recovery Instrument assigns the additional financial means needed for the European Union Recovery Plan to the policy instruments that will address the profound social and economic consequences of the crisis. The Recovery Plan itself extends and profoundly deepends the Union policy response to the crisis. Earlier initiatives taken in response to the crisis include the European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency (SURE) following the COVID-19 virus outbreak (SURE instrument), the “Corona Response Investment Initiative”, the proposed enlargement of the scope of the European Union Solidarity Fund, the reactivation of the Emergency Support instrument and other instruments so support employment such as the European Social Fund and Invest EU.

               

                  
The Recovery Instrument is an essential element in a more powerful and far-reaching policy response to offset the crisis and support the economic recovery and repair process. The Recovery Instrument directs support towards  cohesion instruments, the Recovery and Resilience Facility, and the scaling-up of EU budgetary guarantees to support businesses and investment. 

               

                  
The Recovery Instrument will have the same level of transparency, accountability and audit control as the traditional budget.

               

                  
The very significant financial means distributed under the Recovery Instrument calls for the strong reinforcement of the Commission’s internal capacity to manage and administer this resource. A number of critical business processes will need to substantially upgraded notably: accounting and reporting on distribution and use of the means allocated to the different policies; administration and reconciliation of all payments and transfers to/from Member States, and to beneficiary policies; arrangement of loans and ensuring that all means are available when needed and on the most advantageous terms; the necessary enabling informatics support. Building this capacity in the time-frames needed to implement the Recovery Plan will be indispensable for achieving the objectives of the Recovery Plan.

MANAGEMENT MEASURES 

            

               
2.1.
Monitoring and reporting rules 

            

               
Specify frequency and conditions.

            

                  
Actions receiving financial assistance under this proposal shall report regularly.

               

                  
By 31 March 2023, the Commission shall submit to the Council a report on the progress achieved in the implementation of the Instrument and the use of the funds allocated in accordance with Article 3(2). 

               

               
2.1.1.
Risk(s) identified 

            

                  
Management of risks in the administration of the instrument requires a significant investment in development of the Commission’s financial administrative capacity. This investment explains the administrative expenditure linked to this policy, through the recruitment of specialised staff including from national administrations. The increased staff resources is also needed for support services such as accounting, back-office and dedicated IT support.

               

                  
The Recovery Instrument depends on Commission issuance of large volumes of debt on international capital markets under the empowerment granted by the ORD. The sudden increase in debt issuance in a period when there is likely to be extensive recourse to capital markets by other sovereigns and institutions gives rise to the risk of deterioration in the terms and conditions available to the Union. This risk will be managed through the implementation of a new debt management strategy to help the Union to obtain the best available terms, while safeguarding its very high credit rating. 

               

               
2.1.2.
Information concerning the internal control system set up

            

                  
The European Commission's existing internal control system applies to ensure that funds available under the EU Recovery Instrument are used properly and in line with appropriate legislation. 

               

                  
The current system is setup as follows: 

               

                  
1. The internal control teams focuses on compliance with administrative procedures and legislation in force. The Internal Control Framework of the Commission is used for this purpose. 

               

                  
2. Regular audit of grants and contracts by external auditors, which will be awarded under this instrument will be fully  incorporated in annual audit plans. 

               

                  
3. Evaluation of overall activities by external evaluators. 

               

                  
Actions performed may be audited by the European Anti-Fraud office (OLAF) and the Court of Auditors.

               

               
2.1.3.
Estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls and assessment of the expected level of risk of error 

            

                  
N.A.

               

               
2.2.
Measures to prevent fraud and irregularities 

            

               
Specify existing or envisaged prevention and protection measures.

            

                  
Maximum transparency and proper monitoring of the use of the EU financial resources are required. Reporting obligations for the Member States, other beneficiaries and the Commission will apply.
