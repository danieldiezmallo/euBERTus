Proposal for a
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
amending Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 as regards specific measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector

            

               
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

            

               
1.
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

            

                  
The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the Member States in a sudden and dramatic manner, with a major impact on their societies and economies, as economic activity decelerates sharply. This has created an exceptional situation for the whole EU that necessitates that all available resources, at Union and Member State level, are mobilised to overcome the unprecedented challenges related to the COVID-19 outbreak.

               

                  
On 13 March 2020, the Commission proposed 
a “Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative” directed at promoting investments by mobilising available cash reserves in the European Structural and Investments Funds, to fight the crisis immediately. 
On 19 March 2020, the Commission adopted a new State Aid Framework.

               

                  
However, Member States’ scope for intervention in the area of fisheries is restricted by the provisions of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), which does not presently offer support for the most urgently needed actions to overcome the effects of 
the COVID-19 outbreak. Those limitations restrict Member States’ ability to use the EMFF to fight the crisis.

               

                  
The fishery and aquaculture sector has been particularly hard hit by the market disruption generated by a significant drop in demand. The closure of sales venues, markets, outlets and distribution channels has seen prices and volumes drop substantially. The drop in demand and prices combined with the vulnerability and complexity of the supply chain (perishable products, important need of workforce) made the operations of fishing fleets and seafood production loss-making. Consequently, fishers are forced to stay in port and aquaculture producers will have to discard or destroy products within weeks 
or face exceptional stock management costs, including more space and feed for grown out fish that cannot be slaughtered due to drop in demand
. The rapid decline particularly affects small-scale coastal fishing operators and fish producers.  

               

                  
Because the end of the current crisis cannot be predicted, it can rapidly lead to a cessation of activities and of businesses in a sector that is very sensitive to cyclical variations. This crisis can consequently have dramatic socio-economic consequences in certain communities where fishing and aquaculture play a key role. Small-scale coastal fisheries represent close to 75% of all active vessels and over 55% of direct employment; they constitute the main economic activity in many coastal areas. The fish farming sector sustains coastal communities and rural areas. Fishing and aquaculture operators, being mostly micro-enterprises, often lack the financial reserves to cover on-going costs. Once their operation ceases, marketing chains will be interrupted. 

               

                  
Unlike most other sectors of the economy, fisheries are subject to the Union’s exclusive competence and are regulated at Union level through a common policy, thereby largely excluding national regulations, including those in respect of financial support. The conditions for public support are governed by the EMFF
.
 

               

                  
The Commission is therefore adopting a legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 (the EMFF Regulation), as well as Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 (the CMO Regulation) to introduce specific measures in the EMFF to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector.

CONTENT OF THE PROPOSAL

            

               
The proposed specific measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector comprise:

            

               
–
support to fishermen for the temporary cessation of fishing activities 
caused by the
 COVID-19 outbreak,

            

               
–
support
 
to aquaculture farmers 
for the temporary suspension or the reduction of production caused by the COVID-19 outbreak,

            

               
–
support to 
p
roducer organisations and
 associations of producer organisations 
for the storage of fishery and aquaculture products, in accordance with the Common Market Organisation.

            

               
It is proposed that these measures are retroactively eligible as of 1 February 2020 and available until 31 December 2020. 

            

               
Additional amendments to the EMFF Regulation aim to ensure a flexible reallocation of financial resources within the operational programmes:

            

               
–
a 
deletion of the ring-fenced amounts in Article 13, with the exception of those for fisheries control, collection of scientific data and compensation of additional costs in the outermost regions,

            

               
–
a modification of the 
simplified procedure for amending operational programmes
, in view of
 
the 
introduct
ion of the specific measures
 
and 
the 
reallocation of 
financial 
resources
 t
hereto
.

            

               
The specific EMFF measures are complemented by an amendment to the CMO Regulation to:

            

               
–
enable resort to the storage mechanism 
if
 Member States have not set and published trigger prices,

            

               
–
allow aquaculture producer organisations to benefit from the storage mechanism.

RESULTS OF EX-POST EVALUATIONS, STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

            

                  
The Commission consulted with stakeholders by seeking the input of fisheries and aquaculture producer organisations, Advisory Councils, and receiving feedback about market developments and possible relief measures from industry associations, individual operators and Member States. The stakeholders’ assessment of the crisis situation and of how to fight its effects is almost entirely coherent and unanimous. The Commission took that feedback into account in preparing this proposal.

               

               
5.
B
UDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

            

               
The proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the EMFF remains unchanged.

            

               
With fishing and aquaculture activities locked down or significantly reduced, there is little room for implementing the current EMFF measures and operational programmes normally. Without an effective counter to the crisis, the EMFF stands little chance of being fully implemented by the end of the current programming period. Member States should therefore have the possibility to reallocate at short notice existing financial resources within their operational programme to the specific measures. That possibility will be limited by the budget allocations that Member States have already received, which they cannot exceed.

            

               
The available payment appropriations in the 2020 budget for the EMFF can accommodate a shift between Union Priorities within operational programmes. The new measures will in fact to a large extent replace initially planned initiatives, which are now being stopped due to the general decline of economic activity. By consequence, the proposed measures aim to ensure an effective implementation of the 2020 budget and the 2014-2020 allocation for the EMFF. 

            

               
The Commission will carefully monitor the impact of the proposed modification on payment appropriations in 2020 taking into account both the implementation of the budget and revised Member States forecasts.

Proposal for a

            

               
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

            

               
amending Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 as regards specific measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector

               

            

               
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

            

               
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 43(2)and 175 thereof, 

            

               
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

            

               
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

            

               
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

                  

               
, 

            

               
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

            

               
Whereas:

            

               
(1)
The fishery and aquaculture sector has been particularly hard hit by the market disruption generated by a significant drop in demand
 
ensuing from the COVID-19 
outbreak
. The closure of sales venues, markets, outlets and distribution channels has seen prices and volumes drop substantially. The drop in demand and prices combined with the vulnerability and complexity of the supply chain made the operations of fishing fleets and seafood production loss-making. Consequently, fishers are forced to stay in port and
 fish farmers will have to discard or
 destroy products within weeks. 

            

               
(2)
It should be possible for the 
European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF)
 
established by 
Regulation (EU) 
No 
508/2014

                  

               
 
to
 support 
specific
 measures 
until 31 December 2020 
to 
mitigate
 the 
impact
 of the C
OVID
-19 
outbreak 
in the fishery and aquaculture sector
. These measures should comprise support for the temporary cessation of fishing activities, including for inland fishing, and for the temporary suspension or the reduction of aquaculture production, provided that they
 are the consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak. These specific measures should also comprise support to 
p
roducer organisations and
 associations of producer organisations 
for the storage of fishery and aquaculture products in accordance with 
Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013

                  

               
.
 
E
xpenditure for operations supported under 
these measures should
 be eligible 
as of 1 February 
2020
.

            

               
(3)
The resources available for commitments from the EMFF under shared management should be broken down in a way that ensures that 
fixed amounts
 are established for fisheries control, the collection of scientific data and the compensation of additional costs in the outermost regions. The other resources under shared management should be allocated by Member States on the basis of their needs.

            

               
(4)
Given the 
significant socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak and the need for liquidity in the economy, it
 should be possible to support 
the temporary cessation 
of fishing activities
 caused by the COVID-19 outbreak crisis 
with a 
maximum 
co-financing rate of
 
75 
% of eligible public expenditure
.

            

               
(5)
Given the need for flexibility in the reallocation of financial resources to address the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, support for the temporary cessation of fishing activities caused 
by 
this outbreak should not be subject to a financial capping. This should be without prejudice to the existing financial capping for the other cases of temporary cessation
. T
he obligation to deduct support granted for temporary cessation from support granted for the permanent cessation of fishing activities to the same vessel
 
should
 continue to apply
.

            

               
(6)
Given the urgency of the support needed, it should be possible to 
extend the scope of the 
simplified
 procedure 
to include
 amend
ments to
 operational programmes related to the 
specific
 measures and the 
reallocation of 
financial 
resources thereto
 to address 
the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak
. 
This simplified procedure should cover all the amendments necessary for a full implementation of the measures concerned, including their introduction and the description of the methods for calculating support.

            

               
(7)
Given the key role played by 
producer organisations in
 the management of the crisis, the ceiling for support to production and marketing plans should be increased to 
12 % of the 
average annual value of the production placed on the market. It should also be possible for Member States to grant advances up to 100 % of the financial support to
 producer organisations for this support.

            

               
(8)
The sudden disruptions of fishery and aquaculture activities ensuing from the COVID-19 
outbreak, and the resulting risk of jeopardising markets of fishery and aquaculture products, make
 it appropriate to set up a mechanism for 
storing f
ishery and aquaculture
 products for human consumption. This will aim to foster
 greater market stability, mitigate the risk of having such products wasted or redirected to non-human food purposes, and contribute to absorbing the impact of the crisis on the return on products. That mechanism 
should
 enable fishery and aquaculture producers to make use of the same preservation or conservation techniques for similar species to ensure that fair competition between producers is maintained.

            

               
(9)
Given the suddenness and magnitude of the contraction of demand for fishery and aquaculture products resulting
 
from the COVID-19 outbreak, it should be possible to increase the quantities eligible for storage aid to 25 % of the annual quantities of the products concerned put up for sale by the producer organisation concerned.

            

               
(10)
T
o enable Member States to react promptly to the suddenness and unpredictability of the COVID-19 
outbreak
, they should be entitled to set 
trigger prices
 for their producer organisations to trigger the storage mechanism. Th
ese
 trigger price
s
 should be set in such a way that fair competition between operators is maintained.

            

               
(11)
Given the urgency of the support needed, this Regulation should enter into force as 
soon as possible
.

            

               
(12)
Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013
