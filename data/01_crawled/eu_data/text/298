, which provides for a 36-month implementation period from the date of conclusion of the financing agreement referred to in Article 3(3) of that Decision, for the projects referred to in Article 1 thereof.

(4)
The continuation of the projects referred to in Article 1 of Decision (CFSP) 2017/809 does not have any implication as regards financial resources until 10 August 2021.
(5)
