The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes an unexpected and unprecedented emergency that deeply affects all Member States and obliges them to take immediate action at national level to deal with the ongoing crisis as a priority by reallocating resources reserved for other issues. As a result of this crisis, several Member States are encountering difficulties in finalising the development of IT systems necessary for the application of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2026 as of 1 January 2021. Several Member States as well as postal and courier operators have therefore asked for the postponement of the dates of application of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2026.
