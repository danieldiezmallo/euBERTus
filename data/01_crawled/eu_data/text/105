Proposal for a
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
amending Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 as regards specific measures to provide exceptional temporary support under EAFRD in response to the COVID-19 outbreak

               
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM

            

               
1.
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL

            

               
•
Reasons for and objectives of the proposal

            

                  
The direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 outbreak continue to increase across all Member States. The current situation is unprecedented and requires exceptional measures adapted to the situation to be applied in these circumstances.

               

                  
In the farming and food sectors, many difficulties have been reported, arising from the extensive movement restrictions put in place in the Member States, as well as mandatory closures of shops, outdoor markets, restaurants and other hospitality establishments. Economic disruption to the agricultural sector and rural communities has led to liquidity and cash-flow problems for farmers and small rural businesses processing agricultural products. 

               

                  
As a consequence, certain small businesses and farmers are in urgent need of emergency support in order to maintain their activities. 

               

                  
In view of the parallel difficulties of administrations, which make it be inapropriate for advisers to attend in person to support potential benefiaries, or for controlers to carry out in situ or ex-ante controls, it is indispensible to offer easy-to-use solutions which can be rolled out by Member States, and which can support diverse situations on the ground and which are easily accessible to beneficiaries. 

               

                  
The support will need to be in the form of a temporary aid, for a very targeted purpose in unprecendented circumstances.  In order to achieve these goals, the support will take the form of a one-off lump sum for farmers and for SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. Payments by the Commission shall be made in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding.

               

                  
With a view to ensuring the most efficient use of resources available under existing rural development programmes, Member States will be required to substantiate the targeting of the support to those most affected, based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. Member States would need to include the measure in the RDPs via a modification, although expenditure would be eligible from the moment of the commencement of the catastrophic event (Covid-19 outbreak).

               

               
•
Consistency with existing policy provisions in the policy area

            

                  
The proposal is consistent with the overall legal framework established for the Common Agricultural Policy and the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and is limited to a targeted amendment of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013. The proposal complements all other measures aimed at addressing the current unprecedented situation taken by the Union, in particular those measures aimed at providing support to markets. The proposal is without prejudice to the minimum spending requirements defined in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Article 59 of Regulation (EU) 1305/2013. 

               

               
•
Consistency with other Union policies

            

                  
The proposal is limited to targeted amendments of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 and maintains consistency with other Union policies.

               

               
2.
LEGAL BASIS, SUBSIDIARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY

            

               
•
Legal basis

            

                  
The proposal is based on Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 

               

               
•
Subsidiarity (for non-exclusive competence) 

            

               
The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that the competence for agriculture is shared between the Union and the Member States, while establishing a common agricultural policy with common objectives and a common implementation. The proposal aims at ensuring the common objectives and common implementation of a new Rural Development measure. 

            

               
 
•
Proportionality

            

                  
The proposal comprises limited and targeted amendments which does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective of providing exceptional and temporary relief to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products, who are particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis

               

               
•
Choice of the instrument

            

                  
A Regulation is the appropriate instrument to introduce the additional measure needed to address these unprecedented circumstances.

4.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS

            

               
The proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations under European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) remains unchanged. Considering the time needed for implementing this new measure, it is assumed that payments to beneficiaries will be made in the fourth quarter of 2020, and hence to be financed under the 2021 budget. The payment appropriations needed to finance this measure are to be accommodated within the appropriations for the EAFRD to be included in the forthcoming Commission’s Draft Budget 2021 and will be offset by a corresponding decrease in payment needs in subsequent years.

Proposal for a

            

               
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

            

               
amending Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 as regards specific measures to provide exceptional temporary support under EAFRD in response to the COVID-19 outbreak

            

               
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

            

               
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 42 and Article 43(2) thereof, 

            

               
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,

            

               
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,

            

               
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee

                  

               
, 

            

               
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions

                  

               
, 

            

               
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,

            

               
Whereas:

            

               
(1)
Farmers and rural businesses have been affected by the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak crisis in an unprecedented manner. The extensive movement restrictions put in place in the Member States, as well as mandatory closures of shops, outdoor markets, restaurants and other hospitality establishments, has created economic disruption to the agricultural sector and rural communities and led to liquidity and cash-flow problems for farmers and small rural businesses active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. This has created an exceptional situation which needs to be addressed.

            

               
(2)
In order to respond to the impact of the crisis, a new exceptional and temporary measure should address the liquidity problems that put at risk the continuity of farming activities and of small businesses active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products.  

            

               
(3)
The support, which aims to secure the agro-business competitiveness and farm viability, should, with a view to best concentrating the available resources on beneficiaries mostly suffering from the crisis, be granted based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. In the case of farmers, such criteria may include production sectors, types of farming, farm structures, type of marketing of farm products, number of seasonal workers employed and, in the case of SMEs, sectors, types of activity, type of regions, other specific constraints.

            

               
(4)
Because of the urgency and exceptional character of this measure, a one-off payment and a maximum date for application of the measure should be set, while the principle 
that payments by the Commission shall be made in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding needs to be recalled. 

            

               
(5)
In order to give higher support where farmers or SMEs are most severely affected, it is appropriate to allow Member states to adjust the level of the lump-sums for certain categories of eligible beneficiaries, based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria.

            

               
(6)
In order to ensure adequate funding of the new measure without jeopardising other objectives of the Rural Development programmes, a maximum share of the Union contribution to this measure should be fixed.        

            

               
(7)
Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 should therefore be amended accordingly.

            

               
(8)
In view of the COVID-19 outbreak and the urgency to address the associated public health crisis, it is considered necessary to use the exception to the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.

            

               
(9)
Given the urgency of the situation related to the COVID-19 crisis, it is appropriate that this Regulation enters into force on the date of its publication in the 
Official Journal of the European Union
,

This new proposal does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development remains unchanged.

               

                  
Overall, this measure does not imply the need for extra payment appropriations. The 2021 payment appropriations needed to finance this measure will be offset by lower payment needs in subsequent years.

Sustainable Growth: natural resources

                     

               
There is no impact on commitment appropriations. As this modification will be financed through amendments of Member States’ rural development programmes within the agreed envelopes, no extra payment appropriations will be needed overall, with any payments for this measure to be compensated by lower payments on other rural development measures. 

            

               
It is assumed that the proposal has no impact on EAFRD payment appropriations for the 2020 budget. Taking into account time needed for Member States to implement this new measure, it is anticipated that the related expenditure will be declared in the fourth quarter of 2020, thereby impacting budget 2021. The corresponding impact on payment appropriations, estimated at around EUR 650 million, will be accommodated within the level of payment appropriations to be requested for the Draft Budget 2021 and will be offset by a corresponding decrease in payment needs in subsequent years, as estimated below.
